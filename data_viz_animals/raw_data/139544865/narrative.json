The species appears to occupy coastal swamps. Threats exist at the known location and more generally around the coast of Polillo. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but the AOO must be less than the area of Polillo Island and is therefore less than 629 km\u00b2 (likely considerably less, and realistically it will be less than 500km<sup>2</sup>) and declining, as is the extent and quality of suitable habitat. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criterion B2ab(ii,iii) and may need to be reassessed as Critically Endangered once more data become available. </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Sangabasis carmelae</em> is known from one coastal site on Polillo Island in the Philippines (Villanueva and Dow 2014). The area of Polillo is only 628.9 km\u00b2 so the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species, if genuinely confined to the island, must be less than this; if confined to coastal areas then the AOO will be considerably less.&#160;The AOO is also inferred to be decreasing due to loss of suitable habitats on Polillo.</p>", "population": "<p>This species may be relatively abundant where it occurs but is clearly very local in occurrence.
