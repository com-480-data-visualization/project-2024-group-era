Old records from the Vumba Mountains and Mt. Selinda could not be confirmed and the habitat at these localities has recently been destroyed due to human activities (population growth, building, goldmining).&#160;Even though the locality situated in the Chimanimani National Park the ongoing illegal goldmining in the entire mountain range including the National Park, poses an immediate threat to all aquatic organism in the area. There is an report from the giz on this issue (<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/giz2015-en-tfca-chimanimani.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/giz2015-en-tfca-chimanimani.pdf</a>) and the situation was reported as serious by local conservationists: \"The situation in the Chimanimanis is that there is considerable impact of alluvial goldmining along the upper streams and rivers, particularly on the Mozambique side of the mountains. The impact on the general ecosystem of the mountain habitats is limited and probably not lasting but certainly more serious to the those ecologies directly bound to the streams and stream banks such as your Odonata species\" (e-mail from Bart Wursten on 11th September 2016). Due to the unclear situation of the illegal gold mining in the mountainous regions in Zimbabwe, even within the National Parks, the Vumba Sprite is currently listed as Endangered based on an AOO of 28 km\u00b2, an EOO of 4446 km\u00b2 and 4 locations, which are highly fragmented and threatened by illegal mining and agriculture.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Zimbabwe, where it has been recorded from the Vumba Mountains and Mt.
