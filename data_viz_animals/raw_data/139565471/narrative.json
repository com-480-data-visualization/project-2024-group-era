However, even if the species is still extant the AOO is likely to be small, certainly below 500 km\u00b2, maybe by a very significant amount. Moreover, the AOO is likely to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in the part of Luzon where the species occurs.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Risiocnemis laguna</em> is only known from the type series of three specimens, collected in 1916, from Paete on the opposite shore of Laguna de Bay from Manila on Luzon in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 1991).
