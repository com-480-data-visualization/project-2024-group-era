A long time it was only known from the type records dating back over 80 years; an area of approximately 10,000 km\u00b2 in south-west Angola. Recently it was recorded near Uige in northern Angola. Since the area of occupancy is still very small and the species needs clear and fast running streams, it is listed Near Threatened, closely meeting criteria B2a and B2b(i,ii). The population is still growing unlimited in Africa and with it the intensification of land use (agriculture), habitat destruction (deforestation) and the pollution of water. In Angola mining is also destroying and deteriorating habitats.", "geographicrange": "The species is known from western Angola. Records from the Mwinilunga district of northwest Zambia (Pinhey 1984a) have been re-identified as <em>Aethiothemis basilewskyi</em> (Dijkstra and Vick 2006). It is likely that this species has distribution in Zambia.", "population": "Current population size is unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is known from wooded plateaus in Angola but no exact description of the aquatic habitat is available.", "threats": "There are no known threats for this species.", "conservationmeasures": "More research is needed to gather data on range, population status, habitat and threats.", "usetrade": null}]}
