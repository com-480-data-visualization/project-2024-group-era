{"name": "125986113", "result": [{"species_id": 125986113, "taxonomicnotes": "Even though some previous studies have treated <em>Limia </em>as one of the multiple subgenera in the genus <em>Poecilia </em>(Rosen and Bailey 1963, Meredith<em> et al. </em>2010, Meredith<em> et al. </em>2011), several other works have supported the generic classification for <em>Limia </em>(Rodriguez 1997, Hamilton 2001, Poeser 2003, Palacios <em>et al. </em>2016, Weaver <em>et al. </em>2016). Here we endorse the latter assessment that <em>Limia </em>should be considered a valid, separate genus.<br/><br/>The taxonomic role of genera to express relationships among species is clearly justified in the case of <em>Limia </em>from different points of view. From the biogeographic point of view, species of <em>Limia </em>show  a discrete distribution since they are only found in the Antilles,  specifically on Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica and the island of Grand  Cayman. However, only three species of <em>Poecilia sensu strictu </em>occur in this region and they are restricted exclusively to Hispaniola. In addition, recent phylogenetic analyses have found <em>Limia </em>to be a monophyletic group probably originated from a South American ancestor with the three Hispaniolan <em>Poecilia </em>species mentioned above representing the closest sister group (Palacios <em>et al. </em>2016, Weaver <em>et al.</em> 2016). A very detailed analysis is currently in prep, also confirming <em>Limia </em>as monophyletic (Spikes <em>et al.</em>  in prep). Moreover, there is enough morphological distinctiveness in  characters with adaptive value such is the case of gonopodial traits to  separate species of <em>Limia </em>and <em>Poecilia </em>(Rivas 1978). Furthermore, all of the existing ecological and behavioral literature is using <em>Limia</em>, not <em>Poecilia</em>. Not recognizing <em>Limia </em>as a separate genus from <em>Poecilia </em>may obscure their similarities and cause even more confusion in a group that in fact deserves more taxonomic attention.", "rationale": "<p></p><p><em>Limia yaguajali</em>&#160;occurs in the Yaguajal, Cana, and Jamao al Norte rivers that drain the northern slope of the Dominican Republic. Additional records not yet confirmed from Riviere du Limbe at Limbe in northeastern Haiti may also be referred to this species. Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 413 km<sup>2</sup>. The number of threat-based locations where this species is estimated to be 3-4, given documented occurrence in three major river drainages and the pervasive threat of competitive exclusion with invasive species that are likely to act on each drainage independently. It is known that <em>L. yaguajali</em> is sympatric with other introduced poeciliids (i.e. <em>Poecilia reticulata</em> and <em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>), which probably compete with native ichthyofauna for resources. Recent surveys have failed to collect this species in the Yaguajal river (type locality). Instead invasive Poeciliid species were reported in this locality, which indicate that <em>L. yaguajali</em> has probably been extirpated from this location. Additional threats associated with anthropogenic activities have not been documented in detail, but may affect habitat quality on a regional scale. Given this scenario, it is possible to infer continuing decline in the number of mature individuals, and potentially in the number of subpopulations where this species occurs.
