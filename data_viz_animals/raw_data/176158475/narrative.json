It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 2,488 km<sup>2</sup> and occurs in three locations based on the threat of gold mining. The is inferred to be causing a continuing decline in habitat. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is known only from the Potaro River in Guyana (Lucena and Malabarba 2010). The type locality is Tukeit Falls, Rio Potaro, Mahdia, 5\u00b012'18\"N, 59\u00b026'55\"W, Potaro-Siparuni, Guiana. Records from Para State in Brazil are considered misidentifications.", "population": "The total population size is unknown, but presumed to be declining because of habitat degradation due to gold mining.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "The Potaro River is a blackwater river with tea-stained water, acid pH, very low sediment load (in natural state), high transparency, very low dissolved nutrients and minerals. Substrate is bedrock, gravel, rocks and sand. This species lives in quiet areas near shore, where currents are not as swift. It is oviparous, and omnivorous, eating mainly aquatic invertebrates, but also some vegetable material.", "threats": "This species occurs in areas affected by gold mining. Gold mining is prevalent in most Guyana rivers, both land based and on floating barges that suction up the river's substrate.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no specific information about conservation measures protecting this species. It is present in Kaieteur National Park in Guyana.", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
