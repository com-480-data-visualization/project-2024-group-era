Records from another four locations were treated as <em>Luzonargiolestes</em> cf. <em>baltazarae</em> by Kalkman and Theischinger (2013). However, the assessor considers it likely that at least one of these records, less than 40 km from the type locality, does actually refer to the same species. The other three locations are more distant from the type locality and are left out of consideration for assessment purposes until their status is clarified.<em> </em>Unfortunately threats exist even within the<em> </em>Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data is less than 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 581 km\u00b2. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed as such. It is to be hoped that once more data are available and the taxonomic issue is resolved the species can be reassessed as Vulnerable.<em></em></p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Luzonargiolestes baltazarae</em> is known with certainty only from the type locality in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park in northern Luzon (Gapud and Recuenco-Adorada 2001, Kalkman and Theischinger 2013).

Gapud and Recuenco-Adorada (2001) give the habitat of <em>Argiolestes baltazarae</em> as a small stream covered with undergrowth vegetation, although specimens were also found further away near a river and at a place where the small stream widened into a mountain stream with rock boulders\u201d Kalkman and Theischinger (2013: 26). It appears that this is a forest-dependent stream-breeding species.

Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": "<p><br/></p>"}]}
