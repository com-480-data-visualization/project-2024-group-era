{"name": "109689201", "result": [{"species_id": 109689201, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species <span lang=\"EN-GB\">is&#160; endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia where it is widely distributed in Lake   Towuti and found at one site in Lake Mahalona, occurring in rocky substrate areas. The major threats include pollution  from nickel  mining, eutrophication and most critically invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma </em>sp.), because juveniles of this species are particularly vulnerable to predation due to their small size.&#160;The spread of invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids to Lake Towuti from Lake Mahalona is almost certain and is predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).&#160;This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder<em> et al.</em> 2012) and caused declines in&#160;<em>Tylomelania </em>populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered under criteria A.&#160;<p> </p>", "geographicrange": "<p>The species&#160;is distributed in parts of the Malili Lakes system, Sulawesi, Indonesia. It occurs widely in Lake Towuti (561.1 km<sup>2</sup>) and has also been recorded at two sites in Lake Mahalona (24.4 km<sup>2</sup>).</p>", "population": "<p>The current population trend is unknown, however an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder <em>et al. </em>2012) and are thought to have caused the decline of some <em>Tylomelania</em> species through predation of small adults and juveniles (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Juveniles of this species are particularly vulnerable to predation due to their small size. Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and they are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines&#160;similar to those seen in Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in freshwater lakes where it can be found only on rocks in shallow water to a depth of around one metre.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic. </p>  <p>Many species of <em>Tylomelania</em> are being collected for the aquarium pet trade.&#160;<em>Tylomelania</em>&#160;<em>insulaesacrae </em>does not seem to be traded yet, though, and is unlikely to become a target given its small size and inconspicuous body coloration.<br/><br/>Finally, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn cichlids, <em>Colossoma</em> sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and have unknown but potentially serious consequences through predation (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012), as recent surveys in Lake Matano have found only large individuals of large <em>Tylomelani</em>a species remaining (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). Juveniles of this species are particularly vulnerable to predation from Flowerhorn Cichlids due to their small size.&#160;Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>No conservation plans are currently in place for this species,&#160;but protection of its known localities and habitats is needed.
