{"name": "187069", "result": [{"species_id": 187069, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Annual fishes occur in seasonal temporary ponds, which can be found within a matrix of wetlands. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is 56 km<sup>2</sup>. Threats correspond not only to those in close proximity to the habitat, but also those that are present in the same hydrological basin (especially those upstream), including soy and rice crops, intense <em>Eucalyptus </em>spp. plantations, and harvesting for the pet trade. There are three locations and continuing decline in extent of occurrence (EOO), AOO, and habitat based on these threats. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in seasonal wetlands of south-western laguna Merin basin in Uruguay and Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul), which is part of the Lagoa dos Patos freshwater ecoregion according to Abell <em>et al</em>. (2008).&#160;<br/><br/>The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is 56 km<sup>2</sup>,&#160;based on 14 collection records from National Fish Collections of Uruguay (Facultad de Ciencias). Its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 6,960 km<sup>2</sup>, based on the area of the minimum convex polygon around the 14 known sites of occurrence. These sites are the result of two decades of field research and are likely to accurately represent the distribution of this species.", "population": "No data on population size and trend are available for this species. This species occurs in three disjunct areas that belong to different hydrographic basins. It is possible that the species is severely fragmented but more information on the viability of the subpopulations is required to confirm this.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The habitat for&#160;<em>Austrolebias gymnoventris</em>, as in other  annual   fishes of the genus, is flatland seasonal ponds that remain dry on average for four months (from late spring to autumn, in the southern hemisphere). Dry conditions are necessary for  successful   embryo development and viability (Berois<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014).  Soils   with high percentage of clay seem to be the best for egg  deposition. The   minimum wet period for individuals to reach maturity  and reproduce is   around two months; reproduction is continuous from  adulthood to death   (Berois&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Ponds   may be  filled by rains or adjacent stream floods. Adults are found in a   wide  range of water temperatures from 6\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C, but higher   temperatures  could reduce survival. <em>Austrolebias </em>species feed on aquatic and   terrestrial  invertebrates (microcrustaceans, oligochaetes, insect   larvae,  arachnids, etc.) (Laufer<em> et al.</em> 2009). Potential predators are larger annual (<em>A. prognathus, A wolterstorffi, A. cheradophilus</em>) and non-annual fish (Erythrinidae, Heptapteridae) speciesfish   species,  insect larvae, aquatic snakes and birds.", "threats": "Threats for&#160;<em>Austrolebias gymnoventris</em>&#160;are:&#160;<ol><li>Annual &amp; perennial non-timber crops. The distribution of this species is in areas used for rice and soy crops. &#160;</li><li>Wood &amp; pulp plantations.&#160;<em>Eucalyptus</em>&#160;spp. and&#160;<em>Pinus&#160;</em>spp. plantations occur upstream within the distribution area of this species.&#160;</li><li>Mining &amp; quarrying. These activities are planned in upstream localities in the same basin of one of the distribution areas (Upper Cebollat\u00ed river basin).</li><li>Fishing &amp; harvesting aquatic resources. Annual fishes are very popular in the pet trade, and national regulations of collecting activities are not tight. &#160;</li><li>Abstraction of surface water (agricultural use). Rice crops modify freshwater courses that may affect annual fish populations by draining natural wetlands.</li><li>Nutrient loads. Rice and soy crops use high quantities of fertilisers that may cause eutrophication in seasonal ponds (Zebral <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</li><li>Herbicides and pesticides.&#160;Rice and soy crops use high quantities of these substances that may reduce subpopulation viability.</li><li>Droughts. Considering global climate change predictions, severe droughts for more than two consecutive years may eliminate subpopulations of annual fishes. &#160;&#160;</li><li>Storms &amp; flooding. Annual fish embryos need a brief period (time unknown) of drought to normally complete their development. Floods in spring and summer may negatively affect embryos viability.&#160;&#160;</li></ol>", "conservationmeasures": "Recommended conservation actions are to:<ol><li>Create and promote safe agricultural practices that avoid desiccation, eutrophication and pollution of seasonal ponds and wetlands.</li><li>Create protected areas considering the distribution of all subpopulations of this species. <br/></li><li>Improve national legislation and infrastructure to control harvesting (fishing).</li></ol>Wetlands in Uruguay are supposedly protected by law, but this is not always implemented. All <em>Austrolebias </em>species  are considered priorities for the National Protected Areas System, but  few species (or few localities) are protected within such areas.", "usetrade": "Annual fishes are being used in the pet trade internationally. Eggs in humid peat moss are sold and sent by mail.<em> Austrolebias&#160;</em>species are subject of research in developmental biology, ecology, and evolution (Berois <em>et al.</em> 2015)."}]}
