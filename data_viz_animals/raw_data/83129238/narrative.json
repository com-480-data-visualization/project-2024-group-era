Therefore, the populations are believed to be stable. However, more information is required in order to observe the trends in future development. The species is assessed as VU its very small range&#160; (fewer than five locations known with a known area of occupancy of only 12 km\u00b2) which may be susceptible to even a small scale habitat degradation caused by forest modification and water extraction.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Kadavu Island, Fiji (Donnelly 1990, Van Gossum 2007).", "population": "The species is known from three localities only where it has been observed with large number of individuals. It is probably spread all over Kadavu Island and is a common inhabitant of the island. The populations are assessed as stable because of the large number of specimens taken within a nearly 20-years period of time between the two studies that have established it for Kadavu Island for the moment (Donnelly 1990 and Van Gossum 2007).", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "Inhabits large lowland streams with exposed bedrocks, boulders and waterfalls (Van Gossum et al. 2007).", "threats": "There are no observable threats to this species, but deforestation, water and extraction or water pollution may have an immediate and detrimental effect on the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures proposed for this species. It is believed to be common all around the island and probably does not require any special conservation measures. However, it is endemic to the small island of Kadavu and monitoring on the population size and trends are required.", "usetrade": null}]}
