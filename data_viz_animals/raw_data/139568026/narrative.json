This area is protected as the Aliwagwag Protected Landscape. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is likely to be small, is certainly below 500 km\u00b2 and will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in eastern Mindanao. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed as such. When more data are available from the area where the species occurs re-assessment to a lower threat category might be possible, but if it remains known only from a single location then re-assessment to Critically Endangered will probably be required.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta malleus </em>is known only from the type series of two males from the Aliwagwag Falls area on Mindanao in the Philippines (van Tol 2005).
