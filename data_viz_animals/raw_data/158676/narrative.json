Its population size and trends are unknown and the species has not been recorded regularly during most recent field studies. Surveys concerning status, ecology and range are urgently needed to update the status of this species. For the moment it is assessed as Near Threatened because of its small extent of occurrence (EOO is less than 20,000 km\u00b2) and the threat of habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation, mineral extraction activities, urbanization and the effects of climate change.", "geographicrange": "<em>Melanesobasis maculosa</em> is endemic to Viti Levu Island, Fiji (Marinov and Waqa-Sakiti 2013).", "population": "The population size and trend for this species have not been assessed. Available information is on single individuals mainly recorded all over the marginal zone of Viti Levu Island between 50 and 230 m asl. It has not been recorded regularly during field studies and its status is unclear.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species inhabits high-velocity streams including waterfalls at lower elevations in forested areas.", "threats": "Deforestation/logging, mineral extraction activities, urbanization/habitat alteration and the effects of climate change are all affecting <em>Melanesobasis maculosa</em>.", "conservationmeasures": "Despite the various threats affecting this species, there are no conservation measures in place at present.  Further research is required to fully understand the status, size and range of the population.", "usetrade": null}]}
