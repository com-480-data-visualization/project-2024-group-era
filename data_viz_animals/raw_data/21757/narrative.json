There is only one location on the mountain slopes near Wolseley. The general area was under forest plantation, which has subsequently been felled/cleared and the area is now managed by CapeNature. There has, nonetheless, been a population decline over the last 10 years and no specimens have been seen in the last three years despite regular surveys by the taxon author and colleagues. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Critically Endangered under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Western Cape Province in South Africa, in the Wolseley area.", "population": "There is no information currently available about population size figures, but the overall population is decreasing.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "It occurs in rocky areas in fynbos at the foot of mountain peaks.", "threats": "CapeNature is managing the land on which this butterfly occurs. The alien pine plantations have been removed from this locality as part of CapeNature's management plan. The butterfly is protected within a nature reserve. Despite this active management the number of mature individuals is declining. The reason for the decline in numbers in the last few years has not been determined, but could be due to the ongoing drought.", "conservationmeasures": "Continued protection of the taxon's habitat from alien vegetation invasion is needed. Exploration for more colonies of this taxon on nearby mountain slopes needs to be undertaken.", "usetrade": null}]}
