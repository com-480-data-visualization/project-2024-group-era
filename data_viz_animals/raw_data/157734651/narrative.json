{"name": "157734651", "result": [{"species_id": 157734651, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to hydrothermal vents at deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from three restricted locations, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 1,900 m to 2,489 m bsl, and would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if commercial deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. Mining licences have been granted for two locations, one within the Fiji EEZ and one within the Tonga EEZ. In 2019, the Fijian president called for a ten-year moratorium on mining, however this has not yet been put into effect. The potential for anthropogenic influence at these sites based on exploration licences for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites supports a projected continuing decline in quality of habitat.&#160; However, the other known location lies within an MPA within the USA EEZ, and these populations are protected from the impacts of commercial exploitation and deep-sea mining. Therefore, owing to the significant protection provided by this MPA and the resulting variability in extinction risk for the different populations, we have opted to assess the species as Near Threatened (NT). The species is close to qualifying for a threatened category based on the potential threat of mining activity in a subset of locations where the species occurs. As such, the assessment as NT is dependent on the maintenance of the current marine protection within the USA EEZ vent field. A reassessment would therefore be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of the MPA, whereby the species would become Endangered (EN B2ab(iii)), based on the projected continuing decline in habitat associated with the two locations in mining licence areas. A reassessment would also be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements, for example, if a moratorium on deep-sea mining was reached by the Government of Fiji or the Government of Tonga, whereby the assessment would be likely to decrease to Least Concern.<p></p>", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to three locations at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. The locations lie within the Exclusive Economic Zones of Tonga, Fiji and the USA. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1,900 m bsl to 2,489 m bsl. It has been observed from three vent fields: at the Hine Hina vent field (Location 1) within the Tonga EEZ, the White Lady vent field (Location 2) within the Fiji EEZ, and the Snail vent field (Location 3) within the USA EEZ (War\u00e9n and Bouchet 1993, Chen <em>et al. </em>2018). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (War\u00e9n and Bouchet 1993, Chen <em>et al. </em>2018).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1,900 m to 2,489 m bsl.", "threats": "The Hine Hina (1) and White Lady (2) vent fields lie within the Fiji Exclusive Economic Zone and the Tonga Exclusive Economic Zone, respectively. These regions are not subject to International Seabed Authority governance.&#160;The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The Government of Fiji has previously granted exploration licences for mining companies. However, in 2019, the Fijian president called for a ten-year moratorium on deep-sea mining to allow for further research of the effects of mining on biological communities (Kakee, 2020). This moratorium has not yet been put into effect, however mining has been suspended for the moment. The Tongan government has granted exploratory mining licences to Nautilus Mineral Cooperation and to Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute, allowing them mining access to an area in the Lau Basin (Stone&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;As well as direct impacts, evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. We therefore consider the current exploratory mining and the likelihood of future exploitative mining licences within the Fiji EEZ and Tonga EEZ to be a significant threat to the species. The Snail vent field (3) lies within the USA EEZ and is found within the Mariana Trench National Monument (MTNM) which was established in 2009 (Bush, 2009). Vents within the MTNM are Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and mining is prohibited here (Beaulieu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Richmond&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issues marine mining permits, however they have no authority to issue permits in the EEZ of the US Territories. There is currently no regulatory structure that would allow any deep sea mining&#160;within the USA EEZ of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands&#160;or Guam. The Minerals Management Policy also states that extracting or developing leasable Federal minerals on National Wildlife Refuge System land (i.e. the MTNM) is prohibited (US Fish &amp; Wildlife, 2016). We have therefore concluded that there is no threat to <em>Pachydermia sculpta&#160;</em>at this location at this time.&#160;<p></p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The Snail vent field lies within the Mariana Trench National Monument within the USA EEZ.

We recommend that specific national/international legislation is required for the protection of deep-sea habitats and resources. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along West Pacific Ocean ridges.</p>", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
