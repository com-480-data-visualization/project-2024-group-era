{"name": "109691469", "result": [{"species_id": 109691469, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species has a scattered distribution among the three major lakes of the Malili system on Sulawesi, in Lakes Matano, Mahalona and Towuti, where it is only found in patches within soft substrate areas. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 824 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 48 km<sup>2</sup>. This is counted as two locations with different combinations of the major threats of pollution from nickel mining, eutrophication and invasive species, most critically Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.). The spread of invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids to Lake Towuti from Lake Mahalona is almost certain and is predicted to cause a population decline of at least 50% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids on <em>Tylomelania</em> in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder<em> et al.</em> 2012) and contributed to the decline of <em>Tylomelania</em> populations through predation of small adults and juveniles (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). It is therefore assessed as Endangered given its limited distribution, deterioration of its habitat and the future impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids.", "geographicrange": "<p>The species&#160;is endemic to the Malili Lakes system in Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it occurs in Lake Matano (164.1 km<sup>2</sup>), Lake Mahalona (24.4 km<sup>2</sup>) and Lake Towuti (561.1 km<sup>2</sup>).</p>", "population": "<p>There is no current population information available for this species although it has been reported as abundant at some localities outside of Lake Matano (von Rintelen <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;An overall population decline of at least 50% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012) and are thought to have caused the decline of <em>Tylomelania</em> populations through predation of small adults and juveniles (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti where they are predicted to cause population declines similar to those seen in Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is mostly a soft substrate dweller and is frequently associated with <em>Ottelia mesenterium </em>where it is found buried under its leaves, especially in Lake Mahalona and Lake Towuti.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic. </p>  <p>Many species of <em>Tylomelania</em> are being collected for the aquarium pet trade or for food. This species<em>&#160;</em>does not seem to be traded yet, though, and is unlikely to become a major target. However, it is collected for food.<br/><br/>Finally, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids,&#160;<em>Colossoma</em>&#160;sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and have unknown but potentially serious consequences through predation of small adults and juveniles (Herder&#160;<em>et al.</em>2012), as recent surveys in Lake Matano have found only large individuals of large&#160;<em>Tylomelania</em>&#160;species remaining (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). They have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of at least 50% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>No conservation plans are currently in place for this species,&#160;but protection of its known localities and habitats is needed, along with invasive species control. Research is also needed into the population dynamics, ecology and the threats to this species.</p>", "usetrade": "Several species of <em>Tylomelania </em>of the Malili lakes, including this species,&#160;are collected and eaten locally. Many species of <em>Tylomelania</em> of the Malili lakes are collected and traded as aquarium pets, but this species has not yet been conspicuously traded."}]}
