{"name": "118040814", "result": [{"species_id": 118040814, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The distribution area of this species faces intense pressure for agricultural use, the construction of dams and urban development. Both the extent of occurrence (EOO: 3,943 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (AOO: 20 km<sup>2</sup>) are small, and all individuals are concentrated in one threat-based location. The river's integrity has been affected by pollution from agricultural and urban sources. This, together with the deforestation for the settlement of farms, is deteriorating the habitat quality of this species. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from Tuy River in Miranda state, which drains towards the Caribbean Sea.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate a population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species inhabits the margins of streams and rivers in addition to isolated ponds along these margins (Garc\u00eda-Alzate <em>et al.</em> 2008).", "threats": "The environment where this species dwells has been highly transformed by agriculture and urban development (Oliveira-Miranda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010), mainly by the discharge of waste waters that have caused eutrophication and pollution. Agricultural, industrial and urban development levels are very high in the upper basin of the Tuy River, whereas in the lower basin contamination with suspended solids and waste waters are the main causes of habitat degradation (Gonz\u00e1lez-Oropeza <em>et al. </em>2015).", "conservationmeasures": "Approximately 11.81% of its population occurs within Guatopo National Park. However, most of the population occurs in highly disturbed areas. This species would benefit from habitat restoration and better information on distribution, abundance, population trend and threats.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
