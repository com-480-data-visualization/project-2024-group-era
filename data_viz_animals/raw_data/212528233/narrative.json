{"name": "212528233", "result": [{"species_id": 212528233, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Greece, where it is found in only one spring on Mt. Dirphi, Evvoia Island. It is known from a single location and exhibits preference to a habitat that is severely at risk from human activities, such as water abstraction, and from drought and temperature extremes driven by climatic change. These threats could plausibly push the species into Critically Endangered or Extinct very quickly. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable (VU D2) due its restricted area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO) and the very limited number of locations that are under ongoing and future threats due to human activities and climatic stress.", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to Greece, where it is found in only one spring on Mt.
