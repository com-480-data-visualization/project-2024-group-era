The assessors are aware of records from 17 locations, but all 12 of these date from the late 1940s, there are only recent records from five locations. The species is present in two protected areas: Manupeu Tanah Daru and Laiwangi Wanggameti National Parks. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining to some degree at least, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, due to loss of habitat outside protected areas in Sumba. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 5,249\u201313,878 km\u00b2. Given that the species is confirmed to still occur at as few as five locations, it is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it seems likely that this species is still widespread across Sumba, and it is therefore to be hoped that a reassessment to Near Threatened or even Least Concern will be possible in the not-to-distant future when more information is available.</p><br/><p></p>", "geographicrange": "<p></p><p><em>Orthetrum austrosundanum</em> is only known from Sumba in the Lesser Sunda Islands (Irawan and Rahadi 2018, Lieftinck 1953).
