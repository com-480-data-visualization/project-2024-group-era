The assessor is aware of records from five sites scattered widely over upland areas of southwestern, central and southeastern Hainan, including in Jianfengling, Wuzhishan and Yinggeling national nature reserves, and in Diaoluoshan provincial nature reserve. Its area of occupancy (AOO) is unknown, but it is unlikely to be declining significantly, based on the known distributional information; however, surveys in unprotected areas of Hainan have been limited. Its current known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 3,616\u20136,351 km\u00b2, which is small enough to meet the criterion B1 thresholds for Endangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU), and it is known from five locations. If the AOO or extent or quality of suitable habitat were known to be declining, it would qualify for EN or VU under criterion B1. However, since it is not certain that either the AOO or the quality or extent of suitable habitat is declining, this species is best assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets EN or VU B1ab(iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rhinocypha huai </em>is endemic to Hainan Island, China.
