The Bocon\u00f3 River has been altered by the construction of a dam. Therefore, this species might be affected through habitat loss and at least one of its populations affected by barriers to its genetic flow.", "conservationmeasures": "Around 27% of its population occurs within protected areas such as Yacamb\u00fa, Guaramacal and Sierra Nevada. However, most of its population occurs in areas that have been converted for agricultural use.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
