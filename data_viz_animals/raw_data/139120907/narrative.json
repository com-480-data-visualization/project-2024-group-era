The lack of recent records, despite the fact that fieldwork has been carried out in parts of the range of the species, including around some recorded locations, is highly disturbing. However, the species might still occur in the Wuyi Mountains (parts of which are protected) in Fujian, an area that has not been adequately surveyed in recent times. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is not possible with the available data, but given the lack of even remotely recent records, its AOO cannot be large (certainly smaller than 500 km\u00b2). Moreover, its AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of all natural habitats within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is calculated based on the known collection data, and is approximately 542,000 km\u00b2. However, the species is not known to still occur at any of the recorded locations so that the current EOO is likely to be much smaller. With no records since 1942, it is at least possible that this species is already extinct, and has certainly suffered a severe decline, although the causes for this decline are not understood. The species is best assessed as Critically Endangered, although it is to be hoped that extant populations will be found with further fieldwork and that fresh data might allow reassessment to a lower threat category.", "geographicrange": "<em>Neurobasis anderssoni</em> is only known from old records from seven locations spread across a wide area of China (Asahina 1973, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2004, Orr and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2007, Schmidt 1931, Sj\u00f6stedt 1926); the most recent record of which we are aware dates from 1942.

Since the species has not been found in recent times, it is likely that it is more specialised than currently known and/or is particularly sensitive to disturbance so that it has already vanished from most accessible sites.

Possible threats include clearance of natural habitats for farming, pollution of streams with pesticides and alterations to stream course to feed medium scale hydroelectric projects.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are 1) more searches for extant populations (particularly in the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian), 2) protection of habitat where the species occurs, and 3) more information sought on its exact habitat requirements and its ability to tolerate disturbance. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
