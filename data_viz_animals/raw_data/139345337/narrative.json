At least one location is within a protected area (the Chebaling National Nature Reserve in Guangdong). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible, but with the available data it is unlikely to be large (likely smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2). Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is &gt;27,000 km\u00b2. With only four locations known within a relatively small AOO, the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Chlorogomphus urolobatus</em> is known from four locations in Fujian and Guangdong, China (Chao 1999, Chen 1950, Zhang 2019, unpublished).
