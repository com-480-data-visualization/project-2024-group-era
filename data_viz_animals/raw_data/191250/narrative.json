{"name": "191250", "result": [{"species_id": 191250, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to the  upper Lerma River basin in Toluca Valley, Mexico. Its population has been reduced by over 90% in the last decades, mainly due to pollution from urban, industrial and agricultural activities and from water extraction. The last specimen was collected in Tiacaque in 2005. It is therefore listed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to Mexico where it has been reported from the headwaters of the Rio Lerma, in and near the Valley of Toluca (Barbour and Miller 1978).", "population": "<p>Romero (1967) mentioned that of 5065 captured during a sampling year in Alto Lerma, only 84 belonged to <em>A. barbata</em>. The species had not been collected since 1972 (D\u00edaz-Pardo <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 1993). However, the recent catches report five male and three female specimens in a channel of the Sila River (Figueroa-Lucero and Ontiveros-L\u00f3pez 2000). Because the species was described on the basis of eight specimens from Lerma, State of Mexico (\u00c1lvarez del Villar and Cort\u00e9s 1964) and also that only about one hundred individuals have been captured at present, it can be considered a species with low population densities (D\u00edaz-Pardo <em>et al</em>. 2016). A study published in 2011 visited all the sites where the species had been  recorded until then and was not found in 98% of the sites (Pedraza-Marr\u00f3n 2011). The only site where the species was found is Tiacaque (O. Dominguez-Dominguez pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Based on the above information, this species has suffered a population reduction of over 90% in the last ten years (the species lifespan is not considered to be more than three years, so one generation is less than 3 years).&#160;</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species was found in standing water or streams with slow to moderate current; substrates of sandy silt, mud, or firm clay; depths to at least 1.3 m (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2005); generally with sparse vegetation (Barbour and Miller 1978).&#160;The species spawns during July (Barbour and Miller 1978). <br/></p>", "threats": "The original distribution area of \u200b\u200bthis species (Valle de Toluca) has manifested a clear disappearance of bodies of water, caused by human, industrial, agricultural settlements and by the exploitation of aquifers (D\u00edaz-Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016).The basin of the Lerma River is excessively polluted; the great deterioration of their habitats has caused the extirpation of several species (Soto-Galera <em>et al.</em> 1991, D\u00edaz-Pardo <em>et al.</em> 1993, V\u00e1zquez-Guti\u00e9rrez 1994).&#160;<em><br/></em>", "conservationmeasures": "No known conservation actions for&#160;<em>Algansea barbata</em>&#160;are known.

Criteria 1 implies:  present or threatened destruction, modification, or reduction of a  taxon's habitat or range, including perturbations caused by factors such  as sedimentation, chemical pollution, dewatering, and anthropogenic  modifications to natural channels or flow regimes.
