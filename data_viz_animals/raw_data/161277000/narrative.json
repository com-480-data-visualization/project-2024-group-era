The assessment author is satisfied that they represent this species.", "rationale": "This is a range-restricted species from Mpumalanga Province in South Africa and also from Eswatini (Extent of Occurrence 168 km<sup>2</sup>, Area of Occupancy 32 km<sup>2</sup>). There are three locations. The habitat is declining in the Mountainlands Nature Reserve due to invasive plants. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Endangered under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "It is found in Mpumalanga Province in South Africa, on the hills between the Sheba and Fairview mines near Barberton, to Malolotja National Park in Eswatini.", "population": "Numbers of adults flying recorded at the site range from about six to 30 individuals on any one day.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "It occurs on rocky ridges in montane grassland.", "threats": "The prospect of mining in the Barberton area and the presence of plantations of alien <em>Eucalyptus</em> trees in the vicinity of one of the subpopulations are threats to the continued existence of the butterfly in the area. Fire near or during the flight period is a serious threat to all subpopulations. Grazing and other disturbances are causing ongoing decline to habitat quality. The subpopulation in the Mountainlands Nature Reserve is under threat from habitat modification owing to the effects of grazing by animals not formerly there, road works and trampling by visitors to the reserve. Mining is a potential threat in the reserve.", "conservationmeasures": "A management plan which limits disturbance to the habitat and which includes monitoring of the population is required.", "usetrade": null}]}
