Al\u00f3 <em>et al. </em>(2013) identified <em>A. marinus</em> unambiguously (100% accuracy) both from the genetic and morphological viewpoints.", "rationale": "This species is known only from three localities along the Chilean coast. It has an area of occupancy (AOO) of 12 km<sup>2</sup>. Escapees from industrial salmon cage culture are a potential source of competition and predation. This threat could push the species to becoming Critically Endangered or Extinct in a very short time period. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "Eigenmann (1928), McDowall (1971a) and Cussac<em> et al.</em> (2004) only indicated one locality for this species: Estero Cutipay.
