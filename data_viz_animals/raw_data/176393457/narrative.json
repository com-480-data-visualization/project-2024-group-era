It is known to exist at no more than five locations (four), with an extent of occurrence (EOO) of less than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> (4,523 km<sup>2</sup>), and a continuing decline expected in its EOO, area of occupancy (AOO), area, extent and/or quality of habitat, and number of locations or subpopulations, due to deforestation, agriculture and human population impacts.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the upper Bermejo river basin in the Yungas rainforest region inhabiting small creeks, usually associated with aquatic vegetation, moderate current and clean water.", "population": "This species seems to be relatively abundant in small creeks in the upper Bermejo river Basin. No data about the population are available although a negative impact of anthropic activities such as logging, agricultural use, and industrial and population sewage is expected to be negatively influencing the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species inhabits in slow current waters in small creeks generally associated with aquatic vegetation (F. Alonso pers. obs. 2020).", "threats": "The main threats for this species include several anthropic activities leading to the reduction of the available habitats by deforestation and agriculture, contamination from human populations and industries, and water extraction for those activities. All these threats are expected to reduce the quality on habitats and the suitable available habitats for this species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions for this species, although there are some nature reserves in the area.", "usetrade": "This species is used as bait and sometimes eaten by local human populations (F. Alonso pers. obs. 2020)."}]}
