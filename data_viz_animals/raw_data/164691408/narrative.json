{"name": "164691408", "result": [{"species_id": 164691408, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Brachyrhaphis terrabensis</em> is restricted to the Pacific slope of Costa Rica and western Panama from the Pirr\u00eds River southwestward to the Chiriqui River drainage, with an estimated Extent of Occurrence (EOO) of 6,199 km<sup>2</sup>. Total population size is unknown, but this species is fairly well represented in museum collections. A number of pervasive threats exist in the Pirr\u00eds, T\u00e9rraba, and Coto river drainages, including extensive deforestation, land-use change, and sedimentation associated with plantation agriculture, non-point pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial wastewater discharge, inadequate sewerage, and a number of hydroelectric projects that have altered natural hydrology regimes. These threats have had an inferred impact on habitat extent, availability, and quality. However, given the likely occurrence of this species in headwater streams that remain free from anthropogenic impacts, the number of location where the species occurs is uncertain. Therefore, <em>B. terrabensis</em> is assessed as Near Threatened under criterion B1b(iii).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p></p><p></p><p><em>Brachyrhaphis terrabensis</em> is restricted to the Pacific slope of Costa Rica and western Panama, occurring from the Pirr\u00eds River drainage in Costa Rica southwestward to the Chiriqui River drainage in Panama (Smith and Bermingham 2005, Vega <strong>et al</strong>. 2006, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013), and may feasibly extend into the Tabasara River drainage (R. Gonz\u00e1lez pers. comm. 2019). Elevational distribution ranges from 40-1450 meters above sea level (Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013).

The population trend of this species is unknown, but is suspected to be relatively stable, given it is frequently encountered in surveys (A.

In lower elevation coastal streams, this species is replaced by the close congener <em>B. roseni</em> (Ingley <em>et al</em>. 2014). High elevation streams are routinely devoid of major predators (Rasmussen and Belk 2017). Reproduction occurs throughout the year with a peak during the wet season, and reproductive output may cease completely during the dry season in high elevation streams (Ingley 2015, Rasmussen and Belk 2017, Stallsmith 2018). Diet is comprised mainly of aquatic and terrestrial insects (Bussing 1998).

Additional proposed hydroelectric developments are expected to further reduce habitat quality and availability (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2006a, 2006b). Extensive agriculture has led to deforestation in much of the T\u00e9rraba and P\u00edrris river drainages (Kappelle and Juarez 1995, Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2001). Additionally, reductions in tree cover have probably reduced dry-season flow rates (Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2018). <a name=\"_Hlk20814846\">The Coto River drains extensive areas of plantation agriculture (Spongberg and Davis 1998) that have undergone significant deforestation and land-use changes in the last 35-45 years, and now consist primarily of coffee plantations (Reeves and Lilieholm 1993, Santos-Barrera <em>et al</em>. 2008).
