{"name": "139556008", "result": [{"species_id": 139556008, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Coeliccia werneri</em> is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines where it is known from at least eight locations. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. The AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of lowland forest in Palawan. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) for this species is very likely smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2, and the global population is suspected to be declining and likely also severely fragmented. This species likely qualifies for Endangered status under criterion B1ab(ii,iii) and, taking the precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, is assessed as such.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Coeliccia werneri</em> is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen pers. comm. 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R. M\u00fcller identified by M. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Muller 1997, Lieftinck 1961, Villanueva <em>et al</em>. 2018). The assessor is aware of records from eight locations but it has not been possible to assign separate coordinates to one of these for mapping purposes. The species is present in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area which may receive totally protected status and is likely to be present in the Mount Mantalingajan Protected Landscape and Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park. It is certainly present in the Victoria and Anepahan Ranges in the centre of Palawan, these are not protected but are an Important Bird Area (IBA). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of lowland forest in Palawan. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by that of Palawan (approximately 12,189 km\u00b2). When calculated based on available point localities, the EOO is 3,083 km\u00b2 (this will be an underestimate since it is only based on seven out of eight known localities); when calculated based on the extent of known occupied HydroBASIN areas, EOO is 11,508 km\u00b2 (but this is a large overestimate as the species does not occupy all areas of the HydroBASINs). The true EOO is likely smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2.<br/></p>", "population": "<p>There is insufficient information on this species to make any other statement about populations except that an ongoing decline will be taking place due to loss and degradation of forest on Palawan and that severe fragmentation is very likely.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Very little has been recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it occurs at forest streams. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation resulting from agriculture and logging. BirdLife International (2019a, but based on information from 2001) note (for Palawan in general) that \u201cSmall-scale timber extraction and well-organised logging operations are hastening the depletion of the forest cover on the island\u201d, this is despite the fact that the entire island is a Biosphere reserve. The same source also notes extensive clearance of forest on and south of Mount Mantalingajan, apparently for shifting and permanent agriculture; satellite images present the same picture. For the Victoria and Anepahan Ranges IBA BirdLife International (2019b, but based on information from 2001) state \u201cThe most serious threats to the forests here are illegal logging and kaingin [slash and burn agriculture]. Emigration from other parts of the Philippines to Palawan is high and squatting is commonplace. There are existing concessions for Almaciga resin and rattan gathering, which are often not exploited in a sustainable way. It was reported in early 1999 that a typhoon has caused extensive damage to the forests at Iwahig, destroying the crowns of many trees and hence opening up the canopy, and presumably elsewhere on Palawan. The logging in this IBA in the past also contributed to the extensive forest damage.\u201d</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more information on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Total protection of additional areas in Palawan where the species occurs (for instance Cleopatra\u2019s Needle) is highly desirable. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
