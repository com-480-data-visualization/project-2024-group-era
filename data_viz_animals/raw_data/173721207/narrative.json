Its area of occupancy (AOO) is certainly smaller than 500 km\u00b2 and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its maximum known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 582 km\u00b2. Only two locations known. With this information, and given the degree of deforestation that has already occurred in the region where it is found, the species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Protosticta proboscis</em> is known from the type location in the Bao Loc area in southern Viet Nam (Kompier 2016) and another location in the same area, neither location is protected. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible, but with the available data it will be small (certainly below 500 km\u00b2). Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its maximum extent of occurrence (EOO), based on a minimum convex polygon around the only known occupied HydroBASINS area, is 582 km\u00b2.<br/><br/></p>", "population": "<p>This appears to be a locally occurring and uncommon species, but it may well also be under--recorded. The overall population will be severely fragmented and an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of forest in the area where this species occurs.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Little is known but this species appears to be associated with seepages and wet soil within forest. The species may tolerate some disturbance but more information is needed on this. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threats to this species will be from deforestation, with farming as a major driver, in the Bao Loc area clearance of forest for coffee cultivation in particular is a major threat to this species. </p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for protection of habitat where it occurs and for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
