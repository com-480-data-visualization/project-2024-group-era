{"name": "176424533", "result": [{"species_id": 176424533, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Psalidodon tumbayaensis</em> is endemic to the Grande river basin in northern Argentina. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 6,598 km<sup>2</sup>. The habitat is severely altered and is undergoing continuing decline in habitat. There are two threat-based locations. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "<em>Psalidodon tumbayaensis</em> is known from the type locality, a channel pouring into R\u00edo Grande, in the Quebrada de Humahuaca, Jujuy Province, Argentina (Miquelarena and Menni 2005) and Arroyo de los Sauces, an affluent of the r\u00edo Grande (Mirande <em>et al. </em>2006).", "population": "There is no population estimate for this species. It was described in 2005, but the type material was collected several years earlier, in 1987, and additional lots were collected in 1998.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<em>Astyanax tumbayaensis</em> lives in a small man made, 17-20 cm deep, irrigation channel, beside the road that crosses the small village of Tumbaya in north-western Argentina. The channel has a muddy bottom, with abundant organic deposits that are nearly totally covered by algae, with a few floating plants. Banks are vegetated with grass and other plants. The environmental variables recorded in the same place some years after the original collection (Oct 1998) indicate pH 8.1, water temperature 18.5\u00baC (advanced spring) and low conductivity (Miquelarena and Menni 2005). It also occurs in Arroyo de los Sauces, a natural mountain creek affluent of the Grande river (Mirande <em>et al. </em>2006). It probably form schools, based on the number of specimens collected in the lots (Bogan <em>et al.</em> 2019).", "threats": "The main threats identified for the fishes of the whole Eastern Paranoplatensean ecoregion (L\u00f3pez <em>et al.</em> 2002) are alteration of water courses, dams and hydraulic centrals, habitat fragmentation, resource overexploitation, inadequate management and destruction of vegetation of the basin, unregulated tourism/recreation, as well as the existence of urban concentrations, industrial activities, mining and oil extraction activities. In Jujuy province there are records of exotic species, such as <em>Cyprinus carpio, Oncorhynchus mykiss, </em>and <em>Gambusia affinis</em> (Fern\u00e1ndez <em>et al. </em>2014).The type locality is an artificial water body, along a road, near the village of Tumbaya. Environmental problems reported locally are related to tourism (due to the high influx of visitors), the disposal of solid waste from populations, mining activities, and water use for small-scale agriculture. In the Grande river basin landslides occur at certain times.", "conservationmeasures": "It has been categorized as \"Rara\" (Chebez <em>et al.</em> 2009). The type locality is located in the protected landscape (a provincial protected area) and World Heritage Site \u201cQuebrada de Humahuaca\u201d. Further research is recommended.", "usetrade": "There is no use or trade information for this species."}]}
