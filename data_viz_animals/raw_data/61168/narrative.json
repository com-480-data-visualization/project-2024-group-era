It lives among medium-sized and large rocks in less than 10 m depth. Females, juveniles and non territorial adult males occur in groups. Males are territorial and defend a spawning site inside a cave in the rocky habitat, feeding&#160;feed from the aufwuchs in their territories and upon plankton in the water column above their territories. All non territorial individuals feed on plankton in the water column and mouth-brooding females hide between rocks.
