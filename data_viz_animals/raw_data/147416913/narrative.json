Although nothing was recorded on the habitat requirements of this species, it is very likely to be forest-dependent and if this is the case the species will be threatened by deforestation which is occurring on a large scale in the area where it occurs. Based on the available data the area of occupancy (AOO) of the species is less than 2,000 km\u00b2 (probably much less) and the AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are all inferred to be declining. Taking a reasonable precautionary approach the species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criteria D2 and B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly. When more data are available reassessment to a higher threat category may be needed.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Teinobasis alternans</em> is only known from the type series from two locations in the northeast of Indonesian New Guinea, collected in 1931-1933 (Lieftinck 1935). One of the locations (Hollandia) is present day Jayapura (or somewhere in its vicinity) and it is not known if the species survives at this location. The other is in the Jayapura region and in an area where extensive clearance of forest has occurred (evident from satellite images). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but if genuinely confined to the Jayapura area then it will not be large, certainly below 2,000 km\u00b2, probably by a considerable margin. The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest in the Jayapura area.</p>", "population": "<p>Judging from the size of the type series this species may not have been uncommon at the known localities in the early 1930s but beyond this all that can be said is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred (assuming that the species is forest-dependent) from loss of forest in the Jayapura area.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Nothing was recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it is very likely to be forest-dependent and on that basis an ongoing decline in both extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred from loss of and disturbance to forest in the area in which it occurs.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species is likely to be from clearance of forest, which is occurring throughout its known range because of urban expansion, agriculture and possibly other reasons.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>Additional data and protection of habitat where the species occurs are the priorities for this species.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
