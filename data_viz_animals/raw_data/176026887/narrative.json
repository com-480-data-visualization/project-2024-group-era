The area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 1,040 km<sup>2</sup>. Threats are a combination of deforestation from the agricultural frontier, and urban effluents. Given the regional impacts, there are 4-6 threat-based locations and an inferred continuing decline in habitat.", "geographicrange": "<em>Pimelodus garciabarrigai </em>was described from Lozada Creek, near the junction with Guayabero River, Guaviare basin in Colombia (Dahl 1961). The species is reported in lagoons, creeks and rivers, particularly rivers Up\u00eda, Ariari, Cravo Sur, Cravo Norte, Charte, and Losada. The species is distributed in a range of elevations from 143-353 meters above sea level.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is very wide, best estimated to be 41,154 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 1,040 km<sup>2</sup>. Given the regional impacts, there are 4-6 threat-based locations.<br/><br/>The geographic attributes for&#160;<em>Pimelodus garciabarrigai</em>&#160;in this assessment were compiled, arranged and reviewed from the following sources: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2020), FishNet2 (Fishnet2 2020), FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2019), SiB Colombia (SiB Colombia 2020) and SpeciesLink (SpeciesLink 2020), and complemented with records from the databases of the following ichthyological collections from Colombia: CZUT-IC (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica, Universidad del Tolima, Ibagu\u00e9), IAvH-P (Colecci\u00f3n de Peces de Agua Dulce del Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n de Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos Alexander von Humboldt, Villa de Leyva), ICN-MHN (Instituto de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1), IMCN (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica de Referencia Cient\u00edfica del Museo de Ciencias Naturales Federico Carlos Lehmann Valencia del INCIVA, Cali), and MPUJ (Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural \"Lorenzo Uribe, S.J.\" de la Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot\u00e1).", "population": "The current population trend of&#160;<em>Pimelodus garciabarrigai</em>&#160;is probably stable.
