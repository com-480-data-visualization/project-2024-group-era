Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO)&#160;are estimated to be 12 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is assigned to three threat-based locations. The primary threat to this species is habitat loss associated with urban expansion. &#160;Area of Occupancy and habitat quality are directly impacted by land-use changes and continuing decline in both metrics is inferred. Populations are considered severely fragmented due to a lack of hydrological connectivity and limited gene exchange between subpopulations. Therefore, <em>A. pelotapes</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(ii,iii). Immediate conservation priorities include site protection, population monitoring, and habitat monitoring. Captive propagation and reintroduction into suitable habitat should be evaluated as conservation priorities.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Austrolebias pelotapes</em> is known from a series of small seasonal pools and swamps associated with small tributary streams on the northern margin of the Canal de S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo in the Patos-Mirim lagoon system, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Costa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p><p>Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to b 12 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a 2x2 km grid overlain on known collection localities.
