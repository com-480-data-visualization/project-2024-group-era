The revised extinction risk assessment of Endangered (EN) for <em>N. zimmeri </em>is based on the low number of locations where this species occurs, combined with the existence of continued immediate threats to this species from pollution (due to mining operations on the shores of the lakes), and from habitat destruction and industrial development (driven by increases in the human population). This species is not found in a protected area, and there are no conservation plans in place.<br/><br/><em>Nautilothelphusa zimmeri </em>is uplisted here to EN B1ab(iii). This is because the revised extent of occurrence (EOO) of between 955-1,700 km<sup>2</sup> is below the threshold for EN B1 (&lt;5,000 km<sup>2</sup>), the number of locations (four) is also below the threshold for EN, and the area and quality of habitat is declining.<br/><br/>It is of additional concern that preliminary molecular studies (Schubart<em> et al. </em>2008) indicate that the subpopulation from Lake Matano is genetically distinct from the subpopulations in Lake Mahalona, Lake Towuti and the connecting Tominanga River. This finding could eventually lead to the recognition of <em>N. zimmeri </em>as two separate species, which would further reduce the range and number of locations of this species, and presumably increase its extinction risk.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Sulawesi Selatan in Indonesia where it occurs in Lake Matano, Lake Mahalona, Lake Towuti and in sandy parts of connecting rivers between the three lakes.
