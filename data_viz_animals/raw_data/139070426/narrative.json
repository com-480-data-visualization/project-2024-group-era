At least one of the known locations is within a protected area: the Nanling Nature Reserve in Guangdong. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, however it may well be below 2,000 km\u00b2. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitats, due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is well above the criterion B1 thresholds. This species might be common enough and widely enough distributed that it is not globally threatened at this time so that a case for Least Concern could be made. However, this is difficult to judge with the available data. In view of the uncertainty around its AOO, continuing decline, and it being known from only five locations, it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B2ab(ii,iii)) until more information is available, at which point it is hoped that a reassessment to Least Concern will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Petaliaeschna corneliae</em> is endemic to China where it is known from five locations in Fuijan and Guangdong (Asahina 1982, Zhang 2019, unpublished).
