This species breeds in tree holes and is therefore strongly forest-dependent. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible, but it is likely to be smaller than 500 km\u00b2. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO; 30,907\u201344,789 km\u00b2) is well above the criterion B1 thresholds. However, if the populations from outside Mindanao ultimately prove not to belong to this species (see the Taxonomic Notes section), then its EOO will be significantly reduced. The population is clearly severely fragmented, and significant deforestation threats exist throughout the range of the species. This species is asessed as Endangered under criterion B2 (EN B2ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Pericnemis yakal</em> is known from 11 scattered locations in Samar, Leyte and the eastern side of Mindanao in the Philippines (Villanueva and Dow 2020).
