It may be more widespread but there are currently no data to support this. It has an EOO of 12 km<sup>2</sup>, is known from only one location and there is an observed decline in mature individuals so it meets the threshold for Critically Endangered under Criterion B1. The decline in population size continues as beach seines are still being used around the Nankumba Peninsula.", "geographicrange": "Endemic to Lake Malawi; this species has been collected from around the Nankumba Peninsula.", "population": "The sand cones (bowers) that used to be a very common sight in the shallow water at Cape Maclear at the end of the 20th century, have mostly disappeared in the first 15 years of the 21st century. There is no information whether the population(s) moved to a different, unknown site or whether their numbers have been reduced by beach seine fishers.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "A plankton feeder, foraging in the water column, this species spawns throughout the year but peaks from January to March and again from August to September. Males build cone-shaped bowers (nests) in large breeding arenas off of sandy beaches, in water 3\u201310 m deep.", "threats": "Threatened by overfishing using beach seines.", "conservationmeasures": "Used to occur along Chembe Beach near Lake Malawi National Park but is now rarely seen.", "usetrade": "The species is not targeted by the ornamental fish trade, but is targeted by beach seine fishermen."}]}
