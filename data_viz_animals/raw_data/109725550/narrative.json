{"name": "109725550", "result": [{"species_id": 109725550, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This species is endemic to the Malili Lake system in Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it has been recorded from single sites in both Lake Matano and Lake Towuti. However, this species is now considered Possibly Extinct in Lake Matano after surveys in 2017 and 2018 failed to recover it (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). It is only found on soft substrates and based on current records it has an an area of occupancy (AOO) of 4 km<sup>2</sup> and is found in one threat-based location. Major threats in both lakes include the potential impacts of pollution from nickel mining, eutrophication and, most critically, invasive species. The invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma </em>sp.), introduced to Lake Matano, have had a direct impact on this species as <em>Sulawesidrobia </em>species are an important part of their diet. The spread of invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids to Lake Towuti from Lake Mahalona is almost certain and is predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). As such the species is considered Critically Endangered under the criteria CR A3e; B2ab(iii,v) based on its predicted decline, limited distribution and persistent threats. Surveys are required to confirm whether it is still extant in Lake Matano and to confirm its distribution within Lake Towuti as it may prove to be more widespread than currently known.</p>", "geographicrange": "This species&#160;is endemic to the Malili Lake system  (Sulawesi, Indonesia) where it has been recorded from two lakes (Matano and Towuti) in the complex (Zielske <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). However, recent surveys in 2017 and 2018 failed to recover it in Lake Matano, and given the observed decline in habitats, this species is now considered Possibly Extinct at the known site on north shores of Lake Matano (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). Therefore, based on current extant records, it is now only found in on western shore of Lake Towuti, giving an estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of 4 km<sup>2</sup> and a single threat-based location.", "population": "<p>No specimens of this species were found in Lake Matano in 2017 or 2018, where this species was present in 2013, likely due to the impact of introduced Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma </em>sp.) (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). It is now considered Possibly Extinct within this lake, but is still extant at one site in Lake Towuti. An overall population decline of up to 50% is, therefore, thought to have occurred within the last 10 years. In addition to this, an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of Flowerhorn Cichlids in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). They have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and they are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines in this species similar to those seen in Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This is a rock-dwelling freshwater lake species.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are pollution from the nickel mining adjacent to Lake Matano and water level fluctuations due to hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Additional threats come from siltation due to soil erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes.&#160;</p><p>Most critically, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids, <em>Colossoma</em> sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and <em>Sulawesidrobia</em> species are the most important part of their diet (Herder <em>et al. </em>2012). There is an observed decline in this species in Lake Matano, where no specimens were found in 2017 or 2018. Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/> In addition, a thick algal cover was observed at all six sites visited in Lake Matano in 2017/2018 which covered rocks, submerged roots and also soft substrates. Whilst some algal cover was observed before, this seems to have increased dramatically in existing sites and spread to other sites where no algal cover was observed before on rocks and roots in particular (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). Whether this apparent eutrophication is linked to the eradication of native molluscs by the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlid or to water level regulation by the mining company PT Vale remains to be investigated.&#160;</p>      <p>  </p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are no known conservation actions currently in place for this species and research into potential threats and its distribution is recommended, as surveys are required to determine whether this species is still extant in Lake Matano and if it is more widespread within Lake Towuti than currently known. Monitoring of population trends is also needed, alongside invasive species control.</p>", "usetrade": "This species is not thought to be utilised."}]}
