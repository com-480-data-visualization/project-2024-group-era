Forest fires are a known threat to the Crocker Range populations, but, depending on how widely distributed the species is, they may not be a significant threat to the overall population of this species. With only two known populations and a threat to at least one of these, the species cannot be assessed as Least Concern, but since the known populations are in protected areas and it is very likely to be more widely distributed, it should not be placed in a high threat category at this time. It could arguably be placed in Vulnerable under criterion D2 and is assessed here as Near Threatened for this reason; hopefully it can be reassessed as Least Concern when more data become available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Telosticta fugispinosa </em>is endemic to Borneo, where it is only known from the Poring Hot Springs area of Mount Kinabalu National Park and the Inobong area of the Crocker Range National Park (Dow <em>et al. </em>2016).
