{"name": "83130744", "result": [{"species_id": 83130744, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Teinobasis aerides</em>&#160;is confined to a small mountain area of Pohnpei Island. Its current known extent of occurrence is small (certainly &lt;100 km\u00b2) and, based on plausible threats from habitat degradation and the effects of climate change, it is considered to occur in only one location. The species is reported as uncommon and although it was rediscovered 50 years after its original description; there are no good indications that its populations are stable. For the moment the species is assessed as CR, since single events like climate or habitat destruction might exterminate the entire population. More research is urgently needed.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Pohnpei Island, Federal States of Micronesia.", "population": "Paulson and Buden (2003) consider this species uncommon on the island. They found it in several locations about 50 years after its initial description. However, there are no good indications that the populations are stable.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Paulson and Buden (2003) reported this species as confined to higher-elevation forested areas. In these zone it inhabits seepage areas dominated by the sedge <em>Mapania pacifica</em>&#160;where it probably breeds. Immature individuals were observed among the streamside vegetation and they probably use it for some time during the maturation period.", "threats": "There is insufficient information available about the habitat and ecology of this species to give details on current threats. However, habitat destruction and climate change are plausible threats to this species, which already appears to be rare and uncommon.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures are in place for this species. Studies on population size and trends are recommended.", "usetrade": null}]}
