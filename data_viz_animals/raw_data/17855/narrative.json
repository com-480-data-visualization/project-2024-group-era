There are six locations. At present there is no evidence of population decline, but there is evidence of habitat deterioration as a result of alien vegetation and low frequency of fires. It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable under Criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, from Gaika's Kop at Hogsback and a few localities north and east on the Amatole mountains.", "population": "There is no information currently available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs on rocky outcrops with shrubs, in montane grassland at altitudes above 1,500 m.", "threats": "It is a taxon with small, scattered subpopulations although most of these are not under immediate threat. Three subpopulations are threatened by alien invasive species and overprotection from fire.", "conservationmeasures": "Further field surveys are required to establish the exact range and abundance of this taxon. Control of invasive plants would be beneficial.", "usetrade": null}]}
