Area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is assigned to a single threat-based location. Total population size and population trend are unknown, but this species was rare during all sampling trips. Continuing decline in habitat quality and availability is inferred based on widespread plantation agriculture immediately adjacent to the type locality, and threatens to destroy remaining habitat if expansion is not mitigated. Therefore, <em>C. obscurus</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1b(iii)+2ab(iii). Site protection and captive management are immediate conservation priorities that will likely be necessary to prevent the extinction of this species in the immediate future.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cynolebias obscurus</em><strong> </strong>is known only from its type locality, a series of small vestigial pools adjacent to highway BR-156 near the town of Maca\u00fabas, Bahia state, Brazil (Costa 2014).

This species is assigned to a single threat-based location, given a restricted distribution and localized deforestation associated with agricultural expansion that has resulted in the destruction of all potentially suitable habitat outside of the type locality (Costa 2014).</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown.

The pools measure approximately 3 m wide and extend parallel to the road for about 1 km (Costa 2014). The entire region around the pool is composed of plantation agriculture, without any vestige of original habitat (Costa 2014).</p>", "threats": "<p>The primary threat to this species is the expansion of plantation agriculture, which surrounds the type locality and continues to negatively impact the quality and availability of habitat (Costa 2014). Land-use change associated with agricultural expansion has destroyed all potentially suitable habitat around the type locality (Costa 2014). Continued expansion of plantation agriculture will likely result in the total loss of suitable habitat at the type locality.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>C. obscurus</em>, nor has the species been reported from within the boundaries of any existing protected areas. Additional ichthyological surveys in potentially suitable habitat are urgently needed to clarify the conservation status of this species. Additional information regarding population size and population trend would be useful in clarifying extinction risk. Site protection and captive management are warranted conservation priorities, given the pervasive threat of agricultural expansion that could result in the complete loss of temporary pond habitat in the immediate future. &#160;</p>", "usetrade": "<p>There is no information regarding the use and trade of this species. </p>"}]}
