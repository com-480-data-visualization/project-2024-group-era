{"name": "109725508", "result": [{"species_id": 109725508, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>The species is endemic to the Lake Towuti (561.1 km<sup>2 </sup>) in Sulawesi, where it has been recorded at several sites. The major threats to this species include pollution from nickel mining, eutrophication and, most critically, invasive species. The spread of invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma </em>sp.) to Lake Towuti from Lake Mahalona is almost certain and is predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).&#160;This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) and caused the rapid loss of <em>Sulawesidrobia&#160;</em>populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018).&#160;As such this species is considered Critically Endangered under A3e.</p><p></p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Sulawesidrobia anceps</em><em> </em>is endemic to Lake Towuti in the Malili Lake system  (Sulawesi, Indonesia). It was originally described based on several sites within the lake, including two on Loehe island (Zielske <em>et al</em>. 2010). In this is was noted that it was uncertain whether new&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia&#160;</em>species were confined to lake habitats because other types of water bodies in Sulawesi have not been investigated. However, their occurrence in rivers and springs around the lakes is highly unlikely given their habitat specialisation.", "population": "<p>The current population trend is unknown, however an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012) and caused the rapid loss of <em>Sulawesidrobia </em>populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and they are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines in this species similar to those seen in the <em>Sulawesidrobia </em>populations of Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>This species is only known to occur in the freshwater Lake Towuti&#160;and is a rock dweller.</p>", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic.&#160;Most critically, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn cichlids,<em> Colossoma</em> sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and <em>Sulawesidrobia</em> species are an important part of their diet (Herder<em> et al. </em>2012). The apparent eutrophication in Lake Matano may also be partly due to the removal of most grazers of algae (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are no known conservation actions currently in place for this species.
