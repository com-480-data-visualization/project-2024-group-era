Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>. A single threat-based location is inferred based on the presence of hydroelectric damming development that is projected to impact habitat quality and availability across the known range of the species. Deforestation and cattle ranching are additional, more dispersed ongoing threats. While the immediate impacts of existing threats are currently unknown, it is feasible that continued construction will drive continuing declines in habitat quality and availability in the near future. Therefore, <em>H. villasboas</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Harttia villasboas</em> is only known to occur above a series of two large waterfalls in the Curu\u00e1 River, a tributary of the Iriri River in the area of Serra do Cachimbo, Par\u00e1 State, Brazil (Oyakawa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Collections below the falls have failed to detect this species, suggesting that range might be restricted to the portion of the river above the two falls (Oyakawa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Collections above a smaller series of three waterfalls immediately upstream of the type locality have also failed to detect this species in the upper Xingu River basin (Oyakawa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Endemism in the upper Curu\u00e1 River is consistent with the biogeography of the watershed (Birindelli&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Garcia-Ayala&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p>  Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, calculated by overlaying a 2x2 km grid over known collection localities (Oyakawa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).

The hydroelectric dam PCH Salto do Curu\u00e1 is under construction immediately adjacent to the type locality of this species (Okayawa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Other headwater streams in the upper Xingu River basin are free from major anthropogenic threats (Garcia-Ayala&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The current impacts to the type locality associated with these threats are largely unknown.

Range may extend into the adjacent Reserva Biol\u00f3gica Nascente da Serra do Cachimbo, but currently all known collection records exist outside of the park boundary (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020). Additional survey in the upper Xingu will be necessary to confirm range extent. Further research regarding the direct impact of immediate threats is warranted.
