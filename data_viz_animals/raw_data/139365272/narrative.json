The assessors are aware of records from 15 localities, but six of these date from the colonial period. The species is present in at least one protected area\u2014the West Nature Reserve on Nusakambangan Island\u2014and is likely to be present in others. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, is inferred to be declining to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. It is plausible that its true AOO is smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2, but this needs to be confirmed. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is much larger than the criterion B1 thresholds. Despite the relatively large EOO, with recent records from only nine locations, the species is close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion B2. However, since its AOO is is not yet confirmed to be below 2,000 km\u00b2, and it is not known if the overall population is severely fragmented, <em>Heliogomphus drescheri </em>is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that when more information becomes available, a reassessment to Least Concern might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Heliogomphus drescheri</em> is known from Java and the south of Sumatra (Abdillah <em>et al</em>. 2019; Baskoro <em>et al. </em>2018; Lieftinck 1929, 1934, 1935, 1948, 1954). The assessors are aware of records from 15 localities, but six of these date from the colonial period. Records from Java are spread across the central and eastern parts of the island, but the only published record of which the assessors are aware of from the western part of the island is of a larva (Lieftinck 1948: see the caption to Fig. 11). The species is present in at least one protected area\u2014the West Nature Reserve on Nusakambangan Island\u2014and is likely to be present in others. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species.
