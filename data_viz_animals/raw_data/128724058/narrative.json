This dam is suspected to impact the species and lead to a population decline of 30% in the next 10 years. This species has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 10,960 km<sup>2</sup> and occurs in two threat based locations. The dam is also expected to lead to a continuing decline in the habitat quality. Hence, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "<em>Paraschistura microlabra</em> is endemic to Pakistan and has been recorded in the province of&#160;Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at Ali Mazjid in the Kabul and Unar river drainages, and in tributaries of Siren loghi, Manglhra (Kottelat 2012, M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "population": "This species has been described as rare in&#160;Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (George 1992). More recent population data on size or trend are not known for this species and more research is required. A dam is planned on the Siren River, upstream of Oghi, and this is projected to cause a future population decline.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<em>Paraschistura microlabra</em>&#160;is a freshwater, benthic and carnivorous species, that occurs in shallow semi-cold running rivers with a sandy bed at 800-1,000 m asl (M.
