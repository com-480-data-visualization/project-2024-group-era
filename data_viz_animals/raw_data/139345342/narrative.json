The assessor is aware of records from nine sites spread across upland areas of central and southeastern Hainan, including in Wuzhishan and Yinggeling national nature reserves, and in Diaoluoshan and Jiaxi provincial nature reserves. Its area of occupancy (AOO) is unknown, but it is unlikely to be declining significantly, based on the known distributional information, but surveys in unprotected areas of Hainan have been limited. Its current known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 1,434\u20133,146 km\u00b2, which is small enough to meet the criterion B1 threshold for Endangered; however, it is known from more than five locations (nine locations are currently known), so it cannot be placed in the EN category. If the AOO or extent or quality of suitable habitat were known to be declining, it would qualify for Vulnerable under criterion B1. However, since it is not certain that either the AOO or the quality or extent of suitable habitat is declining, this species is best assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B1ab(iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Chlorogomphus usudai </em>is endemic to Hainan Island, China.
