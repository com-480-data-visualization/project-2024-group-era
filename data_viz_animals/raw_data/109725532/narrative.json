{"name": "109725532", "result": [{"species_id": 109725532, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species is endemic to the 561.1 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>Lake Towuti in Sulawesi,&#160;which is counted as a single location with major threats including the potential impacts of pollution from nickel mining, eutrophication, and invasive species. The species is only found at a single site in Lake Towuti and has an extent of occurrence (EOO) and an area of occupancy (AOO) both of 4 km<sup>2</sup>, which makes it extremely vulnerable to the invasive Flowerhorn cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.).&#160;The spread of invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids to Lake Towuti from Lake Mahalona is almost certain and is predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).&#160;This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012) and caused the rapid loss of&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia&#160;</em>populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018).&#160;It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered given its extremely limited distribution, expected deterioration of its habitat and the future impact of Flowernhorn Cichlids in Lake Towuti.", "geographicrange": "<em>Sulawesidrobia </em><em>abreui </em>is endemic to Lake Towuti in the Malili Lake system  (Sulawesi, Indonesia) and is only known from a single locality, Locha Island, where it was first recorded during surveys between 2003 and 2007 (Zielske&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Recent surveys in 2017 and 2018 have failed to locate any specimens of <em>Sulawesidrobia</em> in Lake Matano (von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Zielske <em>et al.</em> (2010) noted that it is uncertain whether new <em>Sulawesidrobia </em>species were confined to lake habitats because species occurring in other types of water bodies in Sulawesi have not been investigated. However, their occurrence in rivers and springs around the lakes is highly unlikely given their habitat specialisation.", "population": "<p>The current population trend is unknown, however an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma </em>sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012) and caused the rapid loss of <em>Sulawesidrobia </em>populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and they are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines in this species similar to those seen in the <em>Sulawesidrobia </em>populations of Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is only known to occur in the freshwater Lake Towuti&#160;and is a rock dweller.", "threats": "Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric  power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the  outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake  system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly  expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic. Most critically, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids, <em>Colossoma</em> sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and <em>Sulawesidrobia </em>species are an important part of their diet (Herder<em> et al</em>. 2012). The apparent eutrophication in Lake Matano may also be partly due to the removal of most grazers of algae (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).<p></p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>No conservation actions are currently known to be in place for this species and research into potential threats is recommended. Zielske&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2010) noted that it is uncertain whether the new species of&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia</em>&#160;were confined to lake habitats because species occurring in other types of water bodies in Sulawesi have not been investigated. They considered it very likely that&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia</em>&#160;species may also occur in streams and springs surrounding the lakes and hence, could have a wider distribution. Thus, research on its distribution is urgently needed to investigate whether the species is extant in other habitats not impacted by the invasive species and other threats. <br/></p>", "usetrade": "This species is not used or traded."}]}
