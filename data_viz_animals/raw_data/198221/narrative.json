This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012) and caused the loss of the majority of&#160;<em>Caridina</em>&#160;populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017, 2018).&#160;&#160;As such this species is considered Critically Endangered under A3e.</p> <br/>   <p><span lang=\"EN-GB\"></p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Caridina lingkonae</em> is endemic to the Malili Lake system (Sulawesi, Indonesia) and is widely distributed in Lake Towuti. One specimen has been caught in Lake Mahalona (von Rintelen and Cai 2009).", "population": "This is a typical pelagic species that lives in large pelagic swarms (von Rintelen and Cai 2009). The current population trend is unknown, but an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder <em>et al. </em>2012) and caused the loss of the majority of <em>Caridina</em> populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017, 2018).&#160;Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and they are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines in this species similar to those seen in the <em>Caridina </em>populations of Lake Matano.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is regarded as pelagic and lives in large pelagic swarms (von Rintelen and Cai 2009),&#160;although it has&#160;occasionally&#160;been found on various substrates.", "threats": "<p>  </p><p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric   power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the   outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake  system. Siltation due to erosion  and organic effluents from the rapidly  expanding human population around  the lakes are also problematic. This species is also collected for the aquarium trade. Most critically, invasive  species (particularly  Flowerhorn cichlids, <em>Colossoma sp.</em>) have been introduced to Lake Matano and <em>Caridina</em>   species are an important part of their diet (Herder <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species is particularly vulnerable to Flowerhorn Cichlids as it is wood dwelling and mostly occurs in open water. The apparent eutrophication in Lake Matano may also be partly due to the removal of most grazers of algae (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">No conservation plans are currently in place, but protection and management of its known localities is needed along with research into its population dynamics, ecology and threats.</p>", "usetrade": "<em>Caridina lingkonae </em>is available in the aquarium trade."}]}
