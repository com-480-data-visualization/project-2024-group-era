The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 7,819 km<sup>2</sup>. The distribution is located in a region of importance for the  agriculture sector, especially soybean monocultures, which dominates the  whole region. There are at most three locations based on these threats. At present, it is unknown as to whether the threats are causing continuing declines. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in R\u00edo Monday and R\u00edo Tembey, tributaries to the R\u00edo Paran\u00e1 Basin, in Paraguay (Rican and Ricanova 2017).", "population": "The population documentation is null.
