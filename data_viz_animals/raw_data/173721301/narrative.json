{"name": "173721301", "result": [{"species_id": 173721301, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Protosticta spinosa</em> is known from the type series only, which was collected from a non-protected location in Yen Bai Province, northern Viet Nam; the species may already be extinct at that location. The Hoang Lien Son Mountain Range in which it occurs extends into Yunnan Province in China, so the species should be searched for in Yunnan as well as in Viet Nam; serious threats are present over much of this area. Its current area of occupancy (AOO) is only 4 km\u00b2, but given that it is only known to occur in forest above 900 m asl, even with occurrence across a wider range than currently known, the species is likely to have an AOO smaller than 500 km\u00b2. Moreover, its current AOO is observed to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to serious deforestation in the region. Given the threats that exist in the area where this species occurs, it is doubtful that (unless it proves to have a much wider distribution) that it will ever be possible to assess the species as Least Concern and therefore Data Deficient is not an appropriate assessment. This species is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B (CR B2ab(ii,iii)), taking a reasonable precautionary approach as advocated by IUCN. It is hoped that future research will clarify a wider range for the species and a reassessment to a lower threat category will then be possible. However, a reassessment to Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) is equally possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Protosticta spinosa</em> is known only from the type series from a non-protected location in Yen Bai Province, northern Viet Nam (Phan and Kompier 2016). The Hoang Lien Son Mountain Range in which the species occurs extends into Yunnan Province in China, so the species should be looked for in Yunnan as well as in Viet Nam; serious threats are present over much of this area. By 2018 the type location had been largely cleared for a Salmon farm, and it is not known if the species still survives there. Currently, its area of occupancy (AOO) is only 4 km\u00b2 as its only known locality is within one 2x2 km grid cell. If the species is restricted to forest above 900 m asl, even if future research finds the species occurring across a wider range, its AOO will likely be smaller than 500 km\u00b2. Moreover, its current AOO is observed to be declining due to loss of forest within the area that the species is known from. Its current maximum extent of occurrence (EOO), based on a polygon around the only known occupied HydroBASINS area, is 143 km\u00b2.<br/></p>", "population": "<p>All that can be said with the available information is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of forest in the area where the species occurs and if it is not confined to a single location (unlikely) then severe fragmentation is likely for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "The habitat at the only known location for this species is a forest stream on a mountain side. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are observed to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation. Satellite images show that there is already severe deforestation across much of the range of hills and mountains where the only known location for the species is, especially in that area, and extending to high altitudes in many places. The motivations for all of this deforestation are not definitely known to the assessors but clearance for agriculture and/or livestock farming is presumably a major driver, as is illegal logging and clearance along streams for fish farms. By 2018 this area of the type location had been largely cleared for a salmon farm and after much searching one of the assessors (T. Kompier) found a single female only, by now the species may already be extinct at the only known site.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The first priorities for this species are for protection of habitat where it occurs and for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. It is not known if the species occurs in any protected area, but part of the same mountain range, considerably further north than the type locality of the species, is protected as Hoang Lien National Park. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
