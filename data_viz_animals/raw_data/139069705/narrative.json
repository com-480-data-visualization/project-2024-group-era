There are also possible records from two other locations on Luzon. With very few definite records and nothing definite known of its habitat requirements it is best could be assessed as Data Deficient until more data are available. However, despite being protected there are definite threats at and around the type locality. Therefore with only a single definite location, and taking a reasonable precautionary approach, the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2. It is to be hoped that re-assessment to a lower threat category will be possible once more data are available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Indaeschna baluga</em> is known with certainty only from the type locality at Mount Banhao on Luzon in the Philippines (Needham &amp; Gyger 1937), which is within the Mounts Banahaw\u2013San Cristobal protected area.

However if the species is sensitive to disturbance then even populations in Mounts Banahaw\u2013San Cristobal protected area may be under threat: BirdLife International (2019) state that threats in this area \u201care from illegal logging, kaingin [slash and burn agriculture], encroachment into forest areas for permanent agriculture, and the collection of forest products. Hunting in the park remains a problem. Quarrying and mining activities around the park, especially in the towns of Dolores and Sariaya, began to operate in 1994. The large numbers of mountaineers and occasional hikers who visit the park, especially during the summer months (up to 5,000 hikers in a month), put considerable pressure on the natural environment. Moreover, during Holy Week, large numbers of pilgrims of several religious denominations converge on Mt Banahaw. Up to 300,000 pilgrim and hikers are reported to visit the area, particularly in the towns of Dolores and Sariaya\u201d.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priority for this species is for information on its habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance and for more data on its distribution.
