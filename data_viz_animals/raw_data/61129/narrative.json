{"name": "61129", "result": [{"species_id": 61129, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Endemic to Lake Malawi where it is restricted to four rocky areas south of Monkey Bay in the southeastern arm of the lake. It meets the area requirements under criterion B for the threatened categories and occurs at four locations based on the threat of fishing. Subsistence fishing might threaten the population in the future but the effects are uncertain. This species is, therefore, assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi. It occurs in the southern part of the lake between Nkhudzi and Makokola Reef, including Mphandi and Boadzulu islands.", "population": "The species is fairly common at most places in its distribution.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "It is most often found in the shallow intermediate habitat, with most individuals encountered at a depth of about three metres, but some were seen at depths of more than 20 m (Makokola Reef). It is attracted to stirred-up material and has an opportunistic feeding behaviour, picking at anything that moves in the shallow habitat but also at algae attached to rocks. Males in breeding coloration were seen in small foraging groups but none of these showed any territoriality. When males in breeding colours meet there is some aggression but a specific site is not protected and mouth-brooding females have not yet been encountered.", "threats": "Subsistence fishing with hook and line is a potential threat.", "conservationmeasures": "Part of the population occurs in the Lake Malawi National Park.", "usetrade": "This species has not yet been exported for the aquarium trade. It is a food fish but of little importance to subsistence fishermen."}]}
