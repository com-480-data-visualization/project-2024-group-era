{"name": "176667916", "result": [{"species_id": 176667916, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Chilobrycon deuterodon</em> is known only from the Puyango-Tumbes River on the Pacific slope of northwestern Peru, and may extend northward into southern Ecuador. Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 591-4,850 km<sup>2</sup>. Total population size and population trend are unknown. The primary threat to this species is declining habitat quality and availability associated with mining activities in the upper Puyango-Tumbes basin, and agricultural production, cattle ranching, and shrimp aquaculture in the middle and lower basin. However, given limited ichthyological sampling and uncertainties regarding the direct impact, scope, and magnitude of existing threats, the number of threat-based locations where this species occurs cannot be determined with accuracy. Therefore, <em>C. deuterodon</em> is assessed as Near Threatened, because it nearly meets the criteria for a threatened category. Additional sampling, and further study regarding the direct impact of existing threats on <em>C. deuterodon</em> may classify this species for a higher threat category.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Chilobrycon deuterodon</em> is known only from the Puyango-Tumbes River on the Pacific slope of northwestern Peru (Lima 2003). In 1995, occurrence was documented at Rica Playa and Cazaderos (MacDonald Lopez 1995). The type locality of this species is the Trapazol River, a tributary stream of the Tumbes River (Lima 2003). Range may extend northward into the Catamayo River drainage in southern Ecuador (Barriga 2012).</p>  <p>The Puyango-Tumbes River drainage has a surface area of approximately 4,850 km<sup>2</sup>, 60% of which is contained within southern Ecuador, and 40% of which is contained northwestern Peru (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2018). It extends 160 km from El Oro Province southward to the Tumbes Region in northwestern Peru (Marshall 2018). Therefore, Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 591-4,850 km<sup>2</sup>, with a lower estimate generated by calculating a minimum convex polygon around georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2020), and an upper estimate assuming distribution extends throughout the surface area of the Tumbes River drainage. Given few georeferenced collection records and uncertainties regarding the direct impact, scope, and magnitude of existing threats, the number of threat-based locations where this species occurs cannot be estimated with accuracy.</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown. Ichthyological collections at nine stations yielded a total of 200 individuals, which comprised 20.4% of relative fish abundance (Valenzuela Reyna 2014).</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p><em>Chilobrycon deuterodon</em> is known only from the Chira and Puyango-Tumbes Rivers on the Pacific slope of northwestern Peru (Lima 2003). Very little is known about the specific ecology and life history characteristics of this species (Jim\u00e9nez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).

Amalgamation processing occurs primarily in the municipality of Portovelo, Ecuador, where byproducts and wastewater is discharged directly into the Puyango watershed (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Mercury and other co-contaminants (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, copper, cyanide, lead, and zinc) exist in high concentrations immediately downstream of the processing epicentre, but typically exhibited low concentrations further downstream (Marshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, 2020). Low methyl mercury concentrations in sampled fish tissues suggest that the majority of discharged mercury is in inorganic form (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Domestic wastewater discharge and solid waste are additional contaminants in this watershed (Pu\u00f1o 2014).&#160;</p>  <p>Agricultural production and cattle ranching dominate the landscape in the middle and lower region of the basin, and include the production of bananas, rice, corn, fruit, chickens, goats, cattle, hogs, and sheep (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).

The range of this species extends in Tumbes National Reserve (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020), which may provide indirect protection against habitat degradation. Range may further extend into private conservation areas such as Buenaventura and La Ceiba Ecological Reserves in Ecuador (P. Arguello pers. comm. 2021). Additional research regarding distribution, population size, population trend, and the direct impact of existing threats will be necessary to clarify the conservation status of this species.</p>", "usetrade": "<p>There is no information regarding the use and trade of this species.</p>"}]}
