{"name": "145337546", "result": [{"species_id": 145337546, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This unique marine gastropod is restricted to hydrothermal vents at deep ocean ridges in the Indian Ocean. It is currently known from one restricted location, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 1732 m to 2783&#160;m bsl. The impact of uncertainty around the total AOO, EOO and other biological factors mean that the applicable threat level for this species ranges from VU to CR, using the recommended risk tolerance. We have opted to take a precautionary approach based on this level of uncertainty and therefore assessed the species as the top of this range, CR B2ab(iii). The potential for anthropogenic influence in these sites based on exploration licenses for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites supports an inferred and projected continuing decline in quality of habitat. There may already be disturbance to this species as ISA exploration-phase licenses allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing.&#160;A reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining license arrangements.&#160;</p><p></p>", "geographicrange": "<p>This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to one location at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Indian Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.<br/><br/>This location lies within an exploration license contract area granted by the International Seabed Authority to the Chinese Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association. The species is currently known from two vent fields with active black smokers and diffuse venting located at depths of 1732 m to 2778&#160;m&#160;bsl, namely the Longqi and Duanqiao vent fields on the South West Indian Ridge (Chen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Copley&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, Zhou<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2018). These vent localities&#160;lie&#160;in International Waters. This species is present over a small area - the combined total area of the Longqi and Duanqiao vent fields is 0.092 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Tao <em>et al</em>. 2014) and the distance between the two vent fields is 73.27 km.</p><p></p><p></p>", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by manned submersibles, remotely operated vehicles and TV-Grabs, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Chen<em> et al</em>. 2015, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2018).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>The species is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges in the Indian Ocean.

This exploration-phase license was granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in 2011 to the Chinese Ocean Minerals Research Agency. The ISA exploration-phase&#160;licenses&#160;allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing, hence there may already be&#160;disturbance&#160;of the subpopulation. Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al. </em>2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain. These vent fields may be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted.</p><p></p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are no conservation actions currently in place at any Indian Ocean vent fields, however, further research is recommended to determine whether the populations would be susceptible to disturbance by mining, to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the Central and Southern Indian ridges and to ascertain the dispersal capability for this species, as these will assist in re-evaluation of the conservation status of the species. Development of protocols to minimise sediment plume creation by those investigating the sea-bed habitats during exploration for mineral would be beneficial for all species in these sensitive habitats.&#160;</p><p></p>", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
