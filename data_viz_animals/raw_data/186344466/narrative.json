{"name": "186344466", "result": [{"species_id": 186344466, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The Malagasy Striped Whirligig (<em>Heterogyrus milloti</em>)&#160;is an endemic species of Madagascar, known from Ranomafana National Park, Pic d\u2019Ivohibe Special Reserve and Andringitra National Park. Based on known localities, the extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be around 1,318 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>and the minimum area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be around 24 km<sup>2</sup>. However, the species was not found in the Andringitra National Park&#160;during searches in 2006 and 2013, which suggests a decline in the population and number of the locations, as a result of zebu disturbance, fire and deforestation. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered. More research is needed to confirm the recent distribution of this species, and species-focused conservation efforts should be implemented.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to south-eastern Madagascar (Gustafson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be around 1,318 km<sup>2 </sup>and the minimum area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be around 24 km<sup>2</sup>.", "population": "The species is only known from a few localities in Upper Iantara River valley (south-east of Andringitra massif), Pic d\u2019Ivohibe Special Reserve, and Ranomafana National Park.&#160;The type locality is known from Andringitra National Park (Viette 1991), but the species has not been found here since, despite searches in 2006 and 2013 (Gustafson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). This suggests there is a decline in the population.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species was found within montane rainforest, in a gully&#160;with tree debris and boulders, possibly a result of past flooding. Larger pools with greater numbers of specimens were often no more than around 15 cm deep with sandy bottoms and leaf packs (Gustafson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Individuals have also been found in the dark areas under overhanging rocks and logs. In 2013, a specimen was found in a weakly trickling forest floor stream with pools and leaf debris, near pristine humid forest (Gustafson <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species has been recorded jumping downstream, potentially associated with water abundance, and this behaviour may be the result of specialisation to trickling stream habitats (Gustafson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).", "threats": "This species is impacted by high levels of disturbance from trampling zebu and increased nutrient load from dung to the aquatic ecosystems inside the forest. In addition, clearing of the land for agriculture (slash and burn) and fire are threats.", "conservationmeasures": "This species is known to occur in Ranomafana National Park, which should offer reasonable protection to the species. In Pic d\u2019Ivohibe Special Reserve, the species was found in intact near pristine forest and so is also reasonably protected (Gustafson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). However, further research is required to establish whether the species still occurs in Andringitra, and if this is the case, the area would require increased threat mitigation. In addition, more information on the population, habitat, and ecology would be beneficial to guide species-specific conservation action. Gustafson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2017) suggest the use of this species as a flagship species for freshwater conservation.", "usetrade": "This species is not known to be used or traded."}]}
