There is hardly any suitable habitat in the areas in between. The area of occupancy has been calculated to be just 100 km\u00b2, and it has been precautionarily assessed as severely fragmented as dispersel between the various localities is unlikely, and the populations at these localities are small, and potentially unviable. The record of the subspecies <em>Urothemis thomasi aethiopica</em>, which is considered a synonym of <em>Urothemis&#160;thomasi</em> dates back to 1953. The species was never again found in Africa and the record might belong to a vagrant species. Recently Lambret <em>et al.</em> have published a detailed account of the records of <em>Urothemis thomasi</em> in their publication \"Odonata surveys 2010\u20132016 in the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman, with emphasis on some regional heritage species\". A future degradation of the habitat may be expected in this area due to climatic global changes and to human demography, which increased from a factor four in Oman between 1961 and 2003 and should reach now 3,000,000 of inhabitants (FAO, 2005 in http://en.wikipedia.org). A future decline of the species in Oman is therefore expected.

Ten localities have been previously published from Dhofar, of which some are probably extinct due to the drastic modifications in the primary habitat for recreational use in this area (Lambret et al. 2017).&#160;<br/>Lambret et al. (2017) conclude: \"The species now is distributed from the Horn of Africa to the Dhofar, Al-Wusta and to the southern and northern Hajar range in a string of 21 quite distinct localities.\" ... \"Two of the oldest known populations \u2013 recorded 1930 at the type locality Ayn Razat (loc. 75; Longfield 1932; Schneider 1988) and 1978 at Ayn Sahalnaut (loc. 76; Waterston &amp; Pittaway 1991) \u2013 appear to be extinct due to recent habitat management for human recreational activities including channeling and construction of concrete or stony pavements.\"<br/>Lambret et al.
