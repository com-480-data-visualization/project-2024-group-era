{"name": "57486681", "result": [{"species_id": 57486681, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Melanochromis mossambiquensis</em> is endemic to Lake Malawi. It is found along the Mozambique shore of the lake between Chuanga and Nkhungu Reef. It meets the area requirements under criterion B for the threatened categories and occurs at a single location based on the threat of sedimentation. Sedimentation and aquarium trade might threaten the population and cause continuing declines in the population size and habitat quality, but this is uncertain. This species is, therefore, assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi and is found from Chuanga to Nkhungu Reef in Mozambique (Konings-Dudin <em>et al</em>. 2009, Konings and Stauffer 2012).", "population": "This species is very common at Minos Reef in Mozambique (type locality) (Konings-Dudin <em>et al.</em> 2009). Other than that, there is no information on the population size and population trend of this species.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "This species occurs in the intermediate habitat and often gathers in foraging groups feeding from the aufwuchs of small rocks (Konings-Dudin <em>et al.</em> 2009). It shows no specialisation for a particular type of food or habitat (Konings 2007). Males in breeding colouration are usually solitary and rarely join feeding groups (Konings-Dudin<em> et al.</em> 2009). Territoriality is rare, but quarrels between males in breeding colouration are common (Konings-Dudin <em>et al</em>. 2009).", "threats": "This species is threatened by sedimentation near river mouths and by collection for the aquarium trade.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are known for this species.", "usetrade": "It is rarely collected for the aquarium trade and is of no importance to subsistence fishermen."}]}
