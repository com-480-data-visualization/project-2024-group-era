The overall population is believed to be severely fragmented and threats exist throughout the range of the species. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and, with the available data, is below 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely less than 5,000 km\u00b2. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta philippa</em> is known with certainty only from Luzon (Gapud 2006, Lieftinck 1961). Additionally, there are specimens listed as <em>Drepanosticta</em> sp. cf. <em>philippa</em>/<em>trimaculata</em> from Marinduque (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Muller 1997) and Polillo (Villanueva 2010a,b) whose status has not been resolved. The assessor is aware of records from four locations definitely referable to this species, none of which appears to be in a protected area. There are records that might or might not be this species from another six locations but there are excluded from further consideration here. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and, with the available data, is below 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. Extent of occurrence (EOO) based on known data points is 3,209 km\u00b2; the EOO based on known occupied HydroBASIN areas is 8,114 km\u00b2<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\">.

More data on this species are also urgently needed, on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
