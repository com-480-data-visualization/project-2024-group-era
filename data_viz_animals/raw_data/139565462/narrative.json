An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However the known AOO is constrained by the area of Sibuyan (approximately 445km<sup>2</sup>) and at least some ongoing decline in the AOO and the extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred from logging activities and clearance of lowland forest for agriculture. However the overall population appears unlikely to be severely fragmented at this time.

There is also evidence that some illegal logging was taking place on Sibuyan in the early 1990s to produce timber for export to nearby Masbate and Panay. The selective logging of prime timber species has resulted in a reduction in the size and stature of trees and in the density of the preferred timber species. Kaingin [slash and burn] farming is practised only by small proportion of the population, mostly the indigenous cultural communities. Unregulated rattan gathering for handicraft production was a major livelihood activity, but supplies have been reduced to such an extent that is said to be barely economic any longer.\u201d Recent satellite images show disturbance to most of the forest in low lying parts of the island but information on the severity of current threats is lacking.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
