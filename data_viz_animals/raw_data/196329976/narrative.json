{"name": "196329976", "result": [{"species_id": 196329976, "taxonomicnotes": "Differences in morphological, ecological and behavioural traits suggest that the current five-species arrangement does not accurately reflect species diversity within<em>&#160;Kosciuscola</em>&#160;(Tatarnic&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Umbers<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2021). Molecular work has identified species-level clades within&#160;<em>K. tristis</em>.<br/><br/>The recent emergence of major threats from climate change and bushfire, combined with the narrow ranges of these taxa as now understood, is here considered sufficient to justify assessing the reduced species concept of&#160;<em>K. tristis&#160;</em>pending formal publication of the forthcoming taxonomic revision, and to assess the undescribed congeners.", "rationale": "This undescribed species is listed as Vulnerable on the basis that it has an extent of occurrence of 6,474 km<sup>2</sup>, it is considered to occur in fewer than five locations defined by a primary threat from climate change (and secondary threats from fire, invasive species and development), and temperature extremes driven by climate change are resulting in an ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat. Although this species was not strongly impacted by the 2019-2020 bushfire season, an expected increase in the frequency and severity of fires will result in a projected continuing decline in the number of mature individuals and the area of occupancy,", "geographicrange": "This undescribed species occurs in the Victorian Alps in eastern Victoria, Australia. It occurs from 773 to 1,835 m asl. It is likely to be restricted to this area as it occurs at higher elevations and this area provides the only suitable habitat.", "population": "It is a common species that is patchily distributed.&#160;Should the frequency and intensity of bushfires within this species' range increase as expected, then by analogy with the impacts of the 2019-2020 bushfire season on other species this grasshopper will presumably decline.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This flightless species occurs in alpine meadows and shrubland, usually in open woodland but not in closed canopy forest. There is no information on breeding, but based on other species in the genus, it is suspected that it relies on snow to protect the eggs laid in shallow ground from extreme temperatures, especially subzero winter temperatures. The adult stage shows strong affinities with water and drying of the habitat will be detrimental.", "threats": "The main threats to this high-elevation species are likely to be temperature extremes and increases in the frequency and intensity of fire resulting from climate change.&#160;Around 10% of the northern part of its range was impacted in the 2019-2020 bushfires (National Environment Science Program, unpubl. data), and the locality was previously impacted by fires in 2003 and 2016. It will be impacted by other fire events in the future, which are expected to increase in intensity and severity. Invasive species including foxes prey upon the species, and horses disturb the species and degrade the habitat. Climate change is an increasing threat, causing drying of the habitat, shorter periods of snow cover and reduced total snow fall. There is some disturbance within the national park from tourism such as ski resort development. Fire management can be detrimental to this species, especially if conducted in autumn. Shrub encroachment into this species' range has been observed as a presumed consequence of climate change and closed shrubland is likely to limit suitable habitat for oviposition. At present it is unclear whether shrubland is replacing suitable open woodland habitat (which is likely to reduce habitat quality for this species) or whether shrub encroachment into open meadows is improving habitat quality for this grasshopper, which favours areas of open shrubland (K. Umbers pers. comm. 2021). Indications suggest that both processes are ongoing, and the cumulative impact of these habitat shifts on this species is consequently unknown.", "conservationmeasures": "The species occurs in Alpine National Park. Climate change mitigation needs to be the major focus of conservation efforts for this species. Consideration of the life cycle of this species is necessary when planning burns for bushfire management. Restoration of the habitat is needed in some areas. Minimizing development at higher elevations is recommended, as resorts are likely to exacerbate habitat loss already resulting from climate change.", "usetrade": "There is no known use of or trade in this species."}]}
