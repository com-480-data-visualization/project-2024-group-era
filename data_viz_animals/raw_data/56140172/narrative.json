{"name": "56140172", "result": [{"species_id": 56140172, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species has only been recorded from northern Namibia (Kwando River, Bum Hill) and several localities in the Cuando Cubango Province, south-eastern Angola. At the moment there seems to be no immediate threat, but the restricted range qualifies it for Near Threatened. Threats are based on the growing populations and economies in Africa, which go hand in hand with habitat destruction (water management systems, intensified agriculture) and habitat deterioration (water pollution). If habitats are destroyed, this species will easily qualify for VU under B criteria.", "geographicrange": "Recorded from northern Namibia (Kwando River, Bum Hill) and Cuando Cubango Province south-eastern Angola (Luassingua River, Cuito River, Cuebe River). The species is very elusive and we assume it to occur at other localities in Angola as well.", "population": "There is no population information currently available for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Dense vegetation (grass and reeds) along rivers.", "threats": "Pollution of rivers and habitat degradation are the main threats to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "More surveys are needed to get an impression on area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of this species.", "usetrade": null}]}
