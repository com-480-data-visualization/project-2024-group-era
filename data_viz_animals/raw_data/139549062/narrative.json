An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However the AOO may not be large and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest within the range of the species, in particular it is evident from satellite images that little forest remains on Bohol and although forest remains in the area of the location in Samar, satellite images (not up-to-date) show clearance and other disturbance in the area. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criterion D2 and is assessed as such. If the AOO could be more than guessed at the species might well qualify for a higher threat category.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Lyriothemis latro</em> is known from Bohol, Luzon and Samar in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.

The assessor is aware of records from only three specific locations. The type locality is on or in the vicinity of Mount Makiling, a Forest Reserve.
