{"name": "61158", "result": [{"species_id": 61158, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Endemic to the Nankumba Peninsula in Lake Malawi, this range is considered as a single location due to the potential impact of sedimentation, which could effect the entire population. It meets the area requirements under criterion B for Endangered. However, future declines in habitat quality or population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of increasing sedimentation on this species are unknown and it is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it occurs around the northern half of the Nankumba Peninsula, from Otter Point to Domwe Island to Masasa Reef, but not at Thumbi West Island.", "population": "<em>Tropheops microstoma</em>&#160;is regularly seen within its distribution.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It occurs in the intermediate zone at various depths in both sediment rich and sediment free areas, preferring the calm waters of sheltered bays. At Chembe beach juveniles are observed over the open sand where they hide in empty shells of <em>Lanistes nyassanus</em>. Its diet consists of algae from rock surfaces as well as invertebrates.", "threats": "Sedimentation and collection by the ornamental fish trade are potential threats.", "conservationmeasures": "Much of the population is within the Lake Malawi National Park.", "usetrade": "It is irregularly collected by the ornamental fish trade where it is known by its scientific name."}]}
