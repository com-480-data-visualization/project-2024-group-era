{"name": "191187", "result": [{"species_id": 191187, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Chirostoma riojai</em> is a freshwater fish endemic to the headwaters of Rio Lerma basin where it was found in nine localities until 1985. A continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat has been observed as a result of industrialisation and fast population growth in the upper Lerma river basin. The species is currently restricted to only two localities: Laguna Guadalupe Victoria (type locality 7 ha) and the Ignacio Ramirez dam (80 ha) in Valle de Toluca, Mexico (M\u00e9ndez-S\u00e1nchez <em>et al</em>. 2016) with an AOO of less than 1 km<sup>2</sup>. The species is threatened by overfishing, over-extraction of water resources for irrigation and an elevated biomagnification of pesticides at Ignacio Ram\u0131\u0301rez Dam located in an agricultural area with high levels of soil erosion. Fish populations have declined in response to the environmental stress caused by bioaccumulation of these contaminants (Favari <em>et al</em>. 2002). Water conditions are slightly better at the natural lagoon of Guadalupe Victoria, where the local authorities have prevented sewage discharges and the introduction of invasive species in the lagoon (M\u00e9ndez-S\u00e1nchez<em> et al</em>. 2016). The Guadalupe Victoria lagoon is the very last intact habitat relict for this endemic freshwater fish. Considering the species restricted range and threats, it is assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Chirostoma riojai</em> is a freshwater fish species endemic to the headwaters of Lerma river basin where it was found in nine localities until 1985.

Clear to turbid (9\u2013332 UFT), spring-fed lakes and streams, inhabiting relatively shallow, vegetated areas. Found in alkaline (pH 7.4\u20139.7) and well oxygenated (5\u20139 mg l\u22121) waters of low to moderate conductivity (20\u2013340 \u03bcs.cm<sup>-1</sup>) (Soto-Galera <em>et al</em>. 2008). This species is carnivorous,f eeding primarily on zooplankton and fish less than 50 mm SL. It mainly consumes <em>Bosmina coregoni</em>, <em>Paracyclops</em> sp. and <em>Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum</em>; larger individuals eat mostly <em>Daphnia,</em> especially <em>D. catawba</em>.
