{"name": "196329948", "result": [{"species_id": 196329948, "taxonomicnotes": "Differences in morphological, ecological and behavioural traits suggest that the current five-species arrangement does not accurately reflect species diversity within<em> Kosciuscola</em> (Tatarnic <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Umbers<em> et al.&#160;</em>2021). Molecular work has identified species-level clades within <em>K. tristis</em>.<br/><br/>The recent emergence of major threats from climate change and bushfire, combined with the narrow ranges of these taxa as now understood, is here considered sufficient to justify assessing the reduced species concept of&#160;<em>K. tristis&#160;</em>pending formal publication of the forthcoming taxonomic revision, and to assess the undescribed congeners.", "rationale": "This undescribed species is listed as Endangered on the basis that it has an extent of occurrence of 190 km<sup>2</sup>, it is considered to occur in fewer than five locations defined by a primary threat from fire (and secondary threats from climate change, invasive species and development), and temperature extremes driven by climate change are resulting in an ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat. This species was not impacted by the 2019-2020 bushfire season,&#160;but an expected increase in the frequency and severity of fires will result in a projected continuing decline in the number of mature individuals and the area of occupancy.", "geographicrange": "This undescribed species is known from the Bogong High Plains east of Bright in the Victorian Alps of Australia. It could potentially occur a little more widely but it is restricted to higher elevation habitats, and records of \"<em>Kosciuscola tristis</em>\" elsewhere represent other species. It occurs from 1,500-1,850 m asl. Its estimated extent of occurrence is 190 km<sup>2</sup>.", "population": "It can be abundant in suitable habitat at appropriate times of the year. Should the frequency and intensity of bushfires within this species' range increase as expected, then by analogy with the impacts of the 2019-2020 bushfire season on other species this grasshopper will presumably decline.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This flightless species occurs in alpine meadows and shrubland at and above the tree line, usually in open woodland but not in closed canopy forest. There is no information on breeding, but based on other species in the genus, it is suspected that it relies on snow to protect the eggs laid in shallow ground from extreme temperatures. The adult stage needs water and desiccation of the habitat will be detrimental.", "threats": "Reduced snow cover, stochasticity in thermal regimes, and bushfires are an increasing threat to this species.&#160;It is likely that eggs are dependent on the coverage of a reliable winter snow pack, which insulates eggs in the underlying soil from low temperatures and prevents them from exposure to subzero temperatures. Projections suggest that at +3\u00b0C of warming by 2070, this species' range will experience snow-free years, with the potential to result in extreme mortality in the overwintering stage (Umbers <em>et al.</em> 2021). The habitat was not impacted during the recent bushfire events of 2019-2020 but was heavily impacted in a fire in 2016 (although specific impacts on this species are unclear) and will be impacted by others in the future. The woodlands in which it occurs are highly flammable. Invasive species including foxes prey on the species, and horses disturb the species and degrade the habitat. Climate change is an increasing threat, causing drying of the habitat, shorter periods of snow cover and increasing bushfires. There is some potential disturbance within the national park from tourism such as ski resort development. Fire management can be detrimental to this species if undertaken during autumn.", "conservationmeasures": "The species occurs in Alpine National Park. Climate change mitigation needs to be the major focus of conservation efforts for this species. Consideration of the life cycle of this species is necessary when planning burns for bushfire management. Restoration of the habitat is needed in some areas. Minimizing development at higher elevations is recommended, as resort expansion is likely to exacerbate habitat loss already occurring due to climate change.", "usetrade": "There is no known use of or trade in this species."}]}
