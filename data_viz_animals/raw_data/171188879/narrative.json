{"name": "171188879", "result": [{"species_id": 171188879, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This species is limited to a few drainages (Parismina, Matina and Sixaola) on the Atlantic slope southeastern Costa Rica and possibly western Panama. This species is known from a limited number of collection records, and Extent of Occurrence is not expected to exceed 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Land-use changes in the Sixaola River drainage have had documented impacts on the area, extent, and quality of available habitat. Additionally, continuous fish kills resulting from pesticide pollution have been reported. As such, this species is assessed as Endangered (EN) under criterion B1ab(iii,v). More research is needed to reduce uncertainties in distribution, population status, and magnitude of threats.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p>This species is endemic to the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica (Parismina, Matina and Sixaola River drainages), occurring at elevations ranging between 10 and 800 m above sea level (Bussing 1998, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Given the occurrence of the species in the binational Sixaola River basin, it is possible that it also occurs in the waters of western Panama.</p>  <p>Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 2,667 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2020, UCR Fish Collection Unpublished Data). Given the widespread impact of plantation agriculture and associated increases in agricultural pollutants, this species is inferred to occur in three threat-based locations.</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size of this species is unknown. Given the existence of several locally and regionally pervasive threats, population trend is suspected to be declining slowly, although the rate of decline has not been evaluated. &#160;</p>  <p>Specimens in scientific collections are rare. In ichthyological collections at the Museum of the University of Costa Rica, there are only 13 lots with less than 5 specimens each on average (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2020). This species was reported as uncommon by Bussing (1998), who reported fewer than 10 collection localities.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species inhabits creeks and rivers at elevations ranging between 0 and 800 meters above sea level and temperatures ranging between 22 and 31 \u00b0C, where it is usually present in rapids or riffles of high current velocity. This species is almost always stuck to rocks or hidden between stones (Bussing 1998, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Larvae and juveniles migrate from river mouths to upstream water, where they spend their life in freshwater (Bussing 1998). Diet is comprised of mud, diatoms and filamentous algae that it scrapes from the substratum <span lang=\"EN\">(Bussing 1998).</p>", "threats": "<p>High concentrations of heavy metals and pollution from raw sewage discharge have reduced water quality in much of the Sixaola River (Mena-Rivera and Quir\u00f3s-Vega 2018). Much of this region has been developed for plantation agriculture (mainly banana) and pastureland, resulting in habitat modification, deforestation, widespread pesticide pollution, and associated fish kills (Lorion and Kennedy 2009, Polidoro and Morra 2016). These threats are inferred to have direct and continuous impacts on the area, extent, and quality of habitat, and reported fish kills infer a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals.&#160;</p>  <p>A number of threats have the potential to affect the quality of available habitat at localized or regional scales in Panama, including land-use changes associated with banana and teak plantation agriculture, increases in agricultural runoff and sedimentation, and expanding urbanization (Collin 2005, Seeman <em>et al</em>. 2014, Graniero <em>et al</em>. 2016, Larsen 2019). Extractive mining activities and hydroelectric development are additional projected threats, through the scope of their impacts are uncertain (McLarney <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vel\u00e1squez Runk 2012). </p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>S. </em><em>adelum</em>. The range of this species extends into a number of protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020), though existing threats are expected to impact subpopulations within these boundaries. Additional research regarding population size, population trend, and the impact of existing threats would be useful in guiding future conservation action. </p>", "usetrade": "<p>This species is not utilized.</p>"}]}
