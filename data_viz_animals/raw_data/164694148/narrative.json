Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 6,652-33,402 km<sup>2</sup>. This species has only been collected at five discreet localities, and while more comprehensive surveys could reveal additional localities, the number of locations where this species occurs is estimated to be five. Total population size and population trend are unknown. However, this species is poorly represented in museum records and ichthyological surveys within its native range, suggesting that it is uncommon. Existing threats include land-use change and deforestation associated with agricultural expansion and extractive logging within park boundaries. While there is considerable uncertainty regarding the scope, magnitude, and direct impacts of these threats, they are likely to be producing an inferred continuous decline in habitat quality. As such, <em>R. altipinnis</em> is assessed as Vulnerable (VU) under criterion B1ab(iii).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rineloricaria altipinnis</em> is distributed in the Tuira River drainage on the Pacific slope of eastern Panama (Smith and Bermingham 2005, Matamoros <em>et al</em>. 2015, Covain <em>et al</em>. 2016). Ichthyological sampling in Darien National Park only collected this species from Chamurucuate stream (Garc\u00e9s and Garc\u00eda 2007). The type locality of this species is the Chico River (Tuira River drainage) in Darien, Panama (Reis <em>et al</em>. 2003). Additional records have been collected from the Bayano River (R. Gonz\u00e1lez pers. comm. 2019). It is also found in the Sambu River.</p>  <p>Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 6,652-33,402 km<sup>2</sup>, with a lower estimate bounded by a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2019), and an upper estimate bounded by a minimum convex polygon calculated around the Tuira River drainage. </p>  This species is known from five discreet collection localities. While there are uncertainties regarding the scope and magnitude of existing threats, as well as uncertainty regarding the distribution of the taxa (which can most probably be attributed to sparse sampling effort), the number of threat-based locations where this species occurs is estimated to be five.
