The species is known from protected areas in Yunnan (the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve) and Thailand (Doi Phu Kha National Park). Based on the current known distribution, the species should also be looked for in Laos. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, due to loss of forest and other alterations to habitat within the range of the species. Its current known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 11,696\u201320,696 km\u00b2 (its true EOO is likely &lt;20,000 km\u00b2). The species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it is hoped that when more information becomes available, a reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.", "geographicrange": "<em>Cryptophaea yunnanensis</em> is known from three localities in Yunnan, China (Davies and Yang 1996, Zhang 2019 unpublished) and a locality in Thailand (Buppachat <em>et al</em>. 2020).
