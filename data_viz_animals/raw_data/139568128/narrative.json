Threats exist across the known range of the species and the overall population is believed to already be severely fragmented. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but is not likely to be particularly large and with the available data will be below 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criterion B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed as such.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta moorei</em> is known from seven locations on Luzon Island in the Philippines (Gapud 2006, van Tol 2005, van Tol and M\u00fcller 2003). The species is likely to be present in one or more of the protected areas in the north of Luzon but none of the recorded locations appear to be in any of these areas, although some are close. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but is not likely to be particularly large and with the available data will be below 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO), based on known point localities, is 19,350 km\u00b2; EOO based on the extent of occupied HydroBASIN areas is 33,800<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"> km\u00b2.<br/></p>", "population": "<p>This species was common at the type locality but occurs at low densities elsewhere (van Tol and M\u00fcller 2003).

Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
