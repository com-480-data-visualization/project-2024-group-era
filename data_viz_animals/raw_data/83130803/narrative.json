{"name": "83130803", "result": [{"species_id": 83130803, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Teinobasis budeni</em>&#160;is endemic to Pohnpei Island where it is flying all year round. More information is needed to assess the population trend. The species is believed to be common with possibly stable populations however for the moment it is assessed as VU because of the small surface area of the island on which it lives, the low number of localities confined mainly at the low elevations where they are vulnerable to alteration and the increasing use of resources by the growing human population (forest, water).", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Pohnpei Island, Federal State of Micronesia (Paulson 2003).", "population": "Populations are restricted to the island of Pohnpei where the species probably occurs island wide as it was collected in three municipalities (Paulson 2003). The species has been sampled in February and from June to October. Although no information has been published from the type locality the population of this species is assessed here as possible stable.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "The species inhabits lowland rivers. Adults were collected among streamside boulders and vegetation and one male was collected at a swampy stream at 472 m asl (Paulson 2003). The species is probably active all year (Paulson 2003).", "threats": "There are no observable threats to this species, but water extraction and deforestation may bring this species to the bring of extinction in a very short time.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures in place for this species.", "usetrade": null}]}
