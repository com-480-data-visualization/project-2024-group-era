{"name": "57482786", "result": [{"species_id": 57482786, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Copadichromis cyanocephalus </em>occurs in Lake Malawi from Meponda to the mouth of the Lumessi River in Mozambique. It meets the area requirements under criterion B for Endangered&#160;and it is known from one location, based on the threat of fishing. However, continuing declines or extreme fluctuations in population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of subsistence fishing on this species are unknown. Therefore, it is listed as Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi. It is known from&#160;the rocky shores a few kilometres north of Meponda to the mouth of the Lumessi River in Mozambique (Stauffer and Konings 2006).", "population": "No information is available on the population size and population trend of this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species frequents habitats characterised by sandy bottoms with scattered rocks and stones; here territorial males defend bowers at depths of 15\u201322 m (Stauffer and Konings 2006). Females live in small groups and are normally found within a meter from the bottom (Stauffer and Konings 2006).", "threats": "Subsistence fishing using chirimila nets is a potential threat. Sedimentation might impact this species near the Lumessi River mouth, although this river does not carry muddy or gritty sediment in large quantities like most other rivers around the lake (Konings 2007).", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are known for this species. Site management, awareness raising and research are recommended.", "usetrade": "This species is not targeted by the ornamental fish trade, but belongs to a group of plankton-eating cichlids that are targeted by subsistence fishermen."}]}
