{"name": "178303623", "result": [{"species_id": 178303623, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This annual fish occurs in seasonal temporary ponds in the wetlands of the V\u00edboras stream, the Negro,  and Tacuar\u00ed and Yaguaron river basins. The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Threats not only in close proximity to the species habitat but also those that are present in the same hydrological basin (especially those upstream), were considered and include exotic forestation and desiccation of wetlands to prevent flooding and to gain area for soy and rice crops. There are two locations based on these threats, and they have resulted in a continuing decline in AOO, extent of occurrence (EOO), habitat quality and the number of subpopulations/locations. As a result, this species is listed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in the wetlands of the V\u00edboras stream (Lower Parana freshwater ecoregion), the Negro (lower Uruguay freshwater ecoregion), and Tacuar\u00ed and Yaguaron river basins (Lagoa dos Patos freshwater ecoregion), with ecoregions according to Abell&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2008).<br/><br/>The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is 100 km<sup>2</sup>, based on 25 collection records from National Fish Collections of Uruguay (Facultad de Ciencias) and literature review (Cheffe <em>et al. </em>2010). Its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 28,094 km<sup>2</sup>, based on the area of the minimum convex polygon around the known sites of occurrence. These sites are the result of decades of field research and are likely to accurately represent the distribution of this species.", "population": "No data on population size and trend are available for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The habitat for&#160;<em>Austrolebias cinereus</em>, as in other annual  fishes of the genus, is flatland seasonal ponds that remain dry on average for four months (from late spring to autumn, in the southern hemisphere). Dry conditions are necessary for successful  embryo development and viability (Berois<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014). Soils  with high percentage of clay seem to be the best for egg deposition. The  minimum wet period for individuals to reach maturity and reproduce is  around two months; reproduction is continuous from adulthood to death  (Berois&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2018, 2019). Ponds  may be filled by rains or adjacent stream floods. Adults are found in a  wide range of water temperatures from 6\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C, but higher  temperatures could reduce survival. <em>Austrolebias </em>species feeds on aquatic and  terrestrial invertebrates (microcrustaceans, oligochaetes, insect  larvae, arachnids, etc.) (Laufer <em>et al.</em> 2009). Potential predators are larger non-annual fish species (Erythrinidae, Heptapteridae), insect larvae, aquatic snakes and birds.", "threats": "Threats for<em>&#160;Austrolebias cinereus</em> are:&#160;<br/><ol><li>Annual &amp; perennial non-timber crops. The distribution of this species is in areas used for rice and soy crops.&#160;&#160;</li><li>Wood &amp; pulp plantations.&#160;<em>Eucalyptus&#160;</em>spp. and&#160;<em>Pinus&#160;</em>spp. plantations occur upstream within the distribution area of this species.</li><li>Fishing &amp; harvesting aquatic resources. Annual fishes are very popular in the pet trade, and national regulations of collecting activities are not tight. &#160;</li><li>Abstraction of surface water (agricultural use). Rice crops modify freshwater courses that may affect annual fish populations by draining natural wetlands.</li><li>Nutrient loads. Rice and soy crops use high quantities of fertilisers that may cause eutrophication in seasonal ponds.&#160;</li><li>Herbicides and pesticides.&#160;Rice and soy crops use high quantities of these substances that may reduce subpopulation viability (Zebral <em>et al. </em>2018).</li><li>Droughts. Considering global climate change predictions, severe droughts for more than two consecutive years may eliminate subpopulations of annual fishes. &#160;&#160;</li><li>Storms &amp; flooding. Annual fish embryos need a brief period (time unknown) of drought to normally complete their development. Floods in spring and summer may negatively affect embryos viability.&#160;&#160;</li></ol>", "conservationmeasures": "Recommended conservation actions are to:<br/><ol><li>Create and promote safe agricultural practices that avoid desiccation, eutrophication and pollution of seasonal ponds and wetlands.</li><li>Create protected areas considering the distribution of all subpopulations of this species. <br/></li><li>Improve national legislation and infrastructure to control harvesting (fishing).</li></ol>Wetlands in Uruguay are supposedly protected by law, but this is not always implemented. All <em>Austrolebias </em>species are considered priorities for the National Protected Areas System, but few species (or few localities) are protected within such areas.", "usetrade": "Annual fishes are being used in the pet trade internationally. Eggs in humid peat moss are sold and sent by mail. Annual fishes are also subject of research in developmental biology, ecology, and evolution (Berois <em>et al.</em> 2015)."}]}
