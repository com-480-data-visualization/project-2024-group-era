{"name": "165014399", "result": [{"species_id": 165014399, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This species is distributed in Lake Nicaragua and its tributaries on the Atlantic versant of Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica, as well as in the Parismina and Matina River drainages on the Caribbean versant of Costa Rica. There are significant existing and potential threats to Lake Nicaragua and other Caribbean river drainages in Costa Rica, including land-use change resulting from agricultural development, pollution from domestic and agricultural sources, potential interactions with non-native species, as well as the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. These threats are inferred to have resulted in a reduction in the quality of available habitat. However, the Extent of Occurrence does not meet the minimum threshold to assess this species in a threatened category. Therefore, <em>A. hubbsi</em> is assessed as Near Threatened because it is close to meeting the minimum threshold for a threatened category under criterion B. </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Atherinella hubbsi</em> is distributed from southern Nicaragua to northern Costa Rica (Chernhoff <em>et al</em>. 1986, Bussing 1998, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Costa Rica, it has been reported from the Lake Nicaragua, Frio, San Juan, San Carlos, Sarapiqu\u00ed, Tortuguero, Parismina and Matina River drainages at elevations ranging from 35-540 meters above sea level (Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 23,925 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019, GBIF 2019). Given the regionally pervasive nature of existing threats, this species likely occurs in fewer than 10 locations.</p>", "population": "<p>Total population size is unknown. However, this species appears to be relatively abundant where it occurs, especially in the San Carlos and Sarapiqu\u00ed River drainages (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019). Population trend is suspected to be in decline, given recently reported mass mortality events in parts of the species range (Lorion and Kennedy 2009). However, the rate of decline is currently unknown.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p><em>Atherinella hubbsi </em>is a freshwater pelagic species commonly found in creeks and rivers of low to high current velocity at temperatures between 22 and 30 \u00b0C (Bussing 1998). As with close congeners, it forms schools that move swiftly through surface waters (Bussing 1998). Diet is comprised primarily of terrestrial and aquatic insects, and a small amount of algae (Bussing 1998). Maximum reported body size is 7 cm standard length (SL) (Bussing 1998).</p>  <p>Other aspects of the ecology of this species are largely unknown.</p>", "threats": "<p><a name=\"_Hlk5714230\">The majority of land surrounding Lake Nicaragua has been deforested and replaced by plantation agriculture or pasturelands, resulting in increased sedimentation and agricultural runoff (Vammen <em>et al</em>. 2019). Lake Nicaragua has been impacted by point raw sewage discharge and non-point agricultural runoff (Scheibye <em>et al</em>. 2014, McCrary 2015, Vammen <em>et al</em>. 2019). Non-native tilapia <em>Oreochromis </em>spp. are established in Lake Nicaragua and in adjacent drainages (McKaye <em>et al</em>. 1995, McCrary <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, the impacts of non-native species on <em>A. hubbsi</em> are unknown.&#160; The continued construction of the Nicaragua Canal is likely to have major impacts on fish fauna in Lake Nicaragua (Huete-P\u00e9rez <em>et al</em>. 2015, H\u00e4rer <em>et al</em>. 2017).</a></p>  <p>The central and southern Caribbean region of Costa Rica has been developed for plantation agriculture (mainly banana and cocoa) and pastureland, resulting in habitat modification, deforestation, widespread pesticide pollution and associated fish kills (Lorion and Kennedy 2009). These threats are producing inferred and continuous impacts on the area, extent, and quality of habitat, and reported fish kills suggest a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals. The direct compounding impact of existing threats on the distribution and population status of <em>A. hubbsi</em> have not been evaluated in detail. </p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>A. hubbsi</em>. The range of this species includes a number of Protected Areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2019), which are expected to confer indirect protection against habitat modification. More research regarding the impact of regional threats would be useful in guiding future conservation action. </p>", "usetrade": "<p>This species is not utilized. </p>"}]}
