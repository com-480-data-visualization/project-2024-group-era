It has an area of occupancy (AOO) best estimated at 4-8 km<sup>2</sup>. There are threats to the species, including drastic effects of climatic change, and mining initiatives and exotic species in the region could affect it in the future. There is a single location and a continuing decline in habitat inferred based on these threats. For these reasons, it is assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Trichomycterus minus</em> is only known from its type locality in Cuevas river, tributary to Pipanaco Saltpan, in Bel\u00e9n department, Catamarca province, Argentina (Fern\u00e1ndez and Vari 2012).", "population": "There is no population estimate for this species. The number of specimens in the collected lots (with a total of nearly 20) suggest an scarce local population in 2006 (Fern\u00e1ndez and Vari 2012).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The type locality is a small, silt-laden stream flowing along a small rocky canyon into the R\u00edo Bel\u00e9n basin. When sampled, the stream was approximately 0.2 to 1.0 m deep and 1.0 to 2.5 m wide over a sand and rock bottom without aquatic vegetation, had a flow rate of 0.037m<sup>3</sup>/s, a temperature of 20\u00b0C, conductivity 0.614 mS/cm, salinity 0.02%, turbidity 10, pH 8.43, and dissolved oxygen 4.96 mg/l. The drainage lies within an endorheic system that experiences torrential hydrological conditions associated with scarce but intense summer rains. All captured specimens were hiding under rocks, the usual habit for fishes in other streams in the Altiplano. Stomachs of two specimens of <em>Trichomycterus minus</em> contained autochthonous benthic macroinvertebrates (larvae of dipteran [Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae] and Ephemeroptera). The one other species of fish collected at that site was <em>T. alterus</em> (Fern\u00e1ndez and Vari 2012).", "threats": "The main threats identified for the fishes of the whole Western Paranoplatensean ecoregion (L\u00f3pez <em>et al.</em> 2002) are mining and agricultural activities, hydraulic works, construction and laying of gas ducts. Wetlands in this region (Catamarca highlands) face multiple threats, including large-scale mining and unregulated tourism. Lithium mining, in particular, could become the predominant economic activity in the region, with 14 projects at different stages of exploration or exploitation, in addition to the nine other mineral exploitation projects that are already operating today (Wetlands International 2019). Fernandez (2014) also warns about the risks of mining ventures to Trichomycteridae; many Andean drainage systems are impacted by mining operations including mountain mining/valley fill practices primarily for extraction of various minerals. The resultant siltation, mercury pollution, changes in water chemistry, and modifications of the physical aspects of drainage systems (Oliveira Ribeiro<em> et al. </em>1996) put the native aquatic fauna, including endemic catfishes such as <em>T. minus</em>, at risk (Fernandez and Vari 2012). Other regional threats arise from the introduction of exotic species that feed on trichomycterids, such as the Rainbow Trout <em>Oncorhynchus mykiss </em>(Fernandez 2014). Finally, it has been considered that Andean ichthyofauna are drastically affected by climate change (e.g. temperature and UV radiation) (Fernandez and Andreoli Bize 2018).", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions have been identified for this species or its habitat.", "usetrade": "There is no use or trade information for this species."}]}
