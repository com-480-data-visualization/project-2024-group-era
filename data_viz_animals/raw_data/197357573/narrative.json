{"name": "197357573", "result": [{"species_id": 197357573, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Lamprotula seomjinensis</em>&#160;is found in a few patches of the Seomjin River and Bosung River, Jeolla-Province, Republic of Korea. According to our analysis of distributional data, its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated at 736-2,490 km<sup>2</sup> and the area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at a minimum of 56 km<sup>2</sup>. These values meet the criteria B1 and B2 thresholds for Endangered. The species' range is also considered to be divided into three threat-based locations based on the impacts of the main threat of arising from the impacts of dam construction. This number of locations meets the conditions for Endangered under subcriterion a.<br/><br/>This species' habitat shows four types of continuing decline: first, observed decline in the inhabited area induced by the government's water management plan to prevent floods over an extensive and continued period; second, decline in population size suspected from habitat fragmentation; third, qualitative decline of the species\u2019 habitat which can be inferred from decline in water quality; and fourth, decline in population size inferred from reduction of a host fish. Therefore, <em>L. seomjinensis </em>is assessed as Endangered under criteria B1ab(iii,v)+2ab(iii,v).", "geographicrange": "<em>Lamprotula seomjinensis</em> is a freshwater mussel endemic to Republic of Korea (National Institute of Biological Resources 2014). Currently, the distribution of this species is limited to Seomjin River and Bosung River, Jeolla-Province, but it may occur elsewhere in the main river channel.<br/><br/>When covering potential habitats near the observation sites, the area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 56 km<sup>2</sup> based on a 2x2 km grid overlay on the range map. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 736 km<sup>2</sup> based on total area within a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around all known and inferred occurrences, up to a maximum of 2,490 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a MCP around occupied hydrobasins.", "population": "This species is rarely observed in its type locality. About 24 individuals have been recorded in each of three subpopulations in the Republic of Korea, which are Seomjin-River Dam's upper (six individuals; Kondo pers. obs. 2005 in Kondo <em>et al</em>. 2007) and lower (seven individuals; Lee pers. obs. 2013-15 in Lee 2017; H. Kim pers. obs. 2021 in iNaturalist 2023) river bodies as well as Bosung-River Dam's upper region (eleven individuals; de-i-lol-li (user name) pers. obs. 2013; Y. Jeon pers. obs. 2016; H. Kim pers. obs. 2020; H. Kim pers. obs. 2021 in iNaturalist 2023; S. Seong per.s obs. 2021 in iNaturalist 2023). While there are no obvious studies that report the population size or trend of this species, chronic declines in habitat quality and area, as well as the population size of its host fish, Seomjin Bitterling&#160;<em>Tanakia somjinensis&#160;</em>(National Institute of Biological Resources 2011, 2017), suggest this species' numbers are declining steadily.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species is a habitat specialist. Shellfish that specialize in habitat selection are known to be sensitive to riverbed structures and hydrological characteristics (Akiyama and Maruyama 2010, Haag 2012, Vaughn 2012, Campbell and Prestegaard 2016). In a couple of rivers on the south western Korean Peninsula, this species has been exclusively found with substrates composed of cobbles under fast-flowing water within mainstreams (National Institute of Biological Resources. 2014, Kondo <em>et al</em>. 2007). In these areas, which include fertile flood plains with agricultural properties, the hydrological environment and physical structure have been interfered by agricultural activities and flood management plans.<br/><br/>To disperse, the fertilized egg grows from the gills of the mother to glochidium, then attaches to the fins or gills of the fish, undergoes a parasitic period, and transforms into a larva. Shellfish are used as spawning grounds by Acheilognathinae and <em>Sarcocheilichthys</em> fish (Song and Kwon 1989, 1994). While shellfish larvae do not have a preference for hosts (Coker <em>et al</em>. 1921), interactions are concentrated on specific host fish because fish are highly selective to species of shellfish to spawn (Song and Kwon 1994). Therefore, the decrease in the population of Seomjin Bitterling <em>Tanakia somjinensis</em> (National Institute of Biological Resources 2011, 2017), which shows high fidelity to the target species (National Institute of Biological Resources 2011), must negatively affect this species (National Institute of Biological Resources 2012). Other fish in this species' territory are known to prefer other mollusc species so they cannot compensate for the loss of distribution opportunities for this species (Song and Kwon 1989, Kim and Yang 2003, Yeom. pers. comm 2022)", "threats": "The habitat of this species, located in the rivers running floodplain, has been exposed to the following four issues.<br/><br/>(1) Decline in area of habitat: The habitat area of this species, a habitat specialist, is inferred to have decreased due to river management plans, and the decline is expected to continue in the future. Many freshwater mussels are sensitive to the environmental characteristics of their habitats, such as water flow and riverbed structures (Akiyama and Maruyama 2010,&#160;Haag 2012, Vaughn 2012,&#160;Campbell and Prestegaard 2016). The streams where this species lives has been modified by three large dams and chronic dredging to prevent floods. Generally, alterations in substrate composition and water flow brought about by these activities are known to be the most critical cause of the reduction of freshwater mussels (Strayer and Ralley 1993, Heinricher and Layzer 1999, Haag 2012, Konrad <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>(2) Habitat fragmentation: Large dams fragment freshwater mussels' population by blocking sperm drift and host fish migration (Lydeard <em>et al</em>. 2004). There are three subpopulations for the target species: the upper (to Yongdam Dam) and the lower (to Juam Dam) water bodies of Seomjin-River Dam as well as the upper (to the source of the river) water bodies of Boseong-River Dam. In addition to that, these subpopulations have hundreds of in-river barriers (weirs and banks) within their territories. Fragmentation is suspected to cause a decline in population size by decreasing genetic diversity (Haag 2012; Liu <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>(3) Decline in habitat quality: This species has been observed only in clean water. The current water quality of habitats is appropriate. However, it is projected that a steady decline in water quality will accompany a decline in habitat quality. It is known that agricultural wastewater regulates the distribution of freshwater mussels (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2010, Li <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>(4) Decline in the number of individuals: a decrease in host fish is suspected to lead to long-term population decline of this species by limiting genetic exchange (Haag and Williams&#160;2014). Since the decrease in host fish species is also due to the above three factors, it is inferred that the decline will continue if no action is taken.<br/><br/>As such, dams are considered to likely be the biggest threat to this species, and they may define the species as occurring in three threat-based locations:<br/><br/>In the lower part of Seomjin-River Dam, dredging and mining riverbeds have been carried out (ex. 390,000 m<sup>3</sup> of sediments across 2.3 km in Iksan Regional Land Management Office 2009; 1 km<sup>2</sup> of sediments in Iksan Regional Land Management Office 2021; Jeollanam-do 2008), sometimes directly upon this species' historical occupancy (Kim 2022). In addition, Naeseo-Stream Dam is planned to be built in the future (Iksan Regional Land Management Office 2021), so the habitat area is predicted to be reduced and fragmented. In addition, several in-river barriers are installed (Iksan Regional Land Management Office 2009). The Benthic Macroinvertebrates Index (BMI) from the Water Environment Information System (2022) showed a tendency for water quality decline over the past 11 years (2011-2021; Mann-Kendall Test; p&lt;0.005).<br/><br/>In the upper part of Seomjin-River Dam, river dredging has been placed directly on the historical occurrence points of this species (Kondo <em>et al</em>. 2007, 953,000 m<sup>3</sup> of sediments across 1.1 km in Iksan Regional Land Management Office 2009). This subpopulation is isolated between Seomjin-River Dam and Yongdam Dam. Several in-river barriers have been installed. BMI showed a tendency for water quality decline over the past decade (2011-2020; Mann-Kendall Test; p&lt;0.005).<br/><br/>In the upper water bodies of the Boseong-River Dam, river dredging has been frequently conducted to lower the depth of the riverbed to prevent floods (ex. Iksan Regional Land Management Office 2014). More than seven in-river barriers have been identified in this habitat, and subpopulation in this area is isolated by the Boseong River Dam. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) levels have increased over the past 20 years, revealing a tendency for water quality to deteriorate (2002-2021; Mann-Kendall Test; p&lt;0.005).", "conservationmeasures": "This species does not occur in any known protected areas. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the life history and dispersal abilities of this species as well as the magnitude of host species populations. As a result of this investigation, it is necessary to set up conservation strategies to overcome habitat fragmentation and to effectively remove barriers in rivers. Agricultural land located around the habitat should also be managed to reduce non-point pollutants. Residents consume freshwater shellfish and fish, including this species and its hosts. During the main breeding season between October and April of the following year, persuasion and publicity should be conducted to regulate fishing.", "usetrade": "Residents consume freshwater shellfish and fish, including this species and its hosts. This alone would not appear to be a critical factor driving this species to extinction. Even so, combined with fragmentation, it may boost the loss of genetic diversity in population."}]}
