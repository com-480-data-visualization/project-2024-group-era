The species is threatened by water pollution from sugar mill discharges, human sewage, in addition to industrial, farming and agricultural run-off. A continuing decline in the quality of the species' natural habitat has been observed.

It occurs in two river drainages on the Pacific Slope, the R\u00edo Purificaci\u00f3n drainage with the R\u00edo Purificaci\u00f3n and its tributaries, including the bigger ones R\u00edo Ambor\u00edn and arroyos El Tecolote and Carmes\u00ed, and the R\u00edo Marabasco drainage with the R\u00edo Marabasco and its tributaries, among them the bigger ones r\u00edos Ayotitl\u00e1n and Cuzalapa.

It prefers depths less than 1 m, but typically not under 0.5 m. The temperature in March and April 1975 had been between 22.8 and 25.6\u00b0C (Miller 2005). Miller caught young fish in March and April (1975), of 13 and 14 mm in length. In captivity, it produces fry every month except August and December (Kingston 1979), suggesting a long reproductive period. The gut is relatively short (0.85% of the TL) and the teeth, as well as the jaws, are very strong. The anterior row is bifid. The gut suggests a carnivorous feeding habit, the teeth might be an indication for omnivorous feeding habits, however with preferring small invertebrates.<p></p><p></p>", "threats": "The species is threatened by<span> water pollution from sugar mill discharges, human sewage, industrial farming and agricultural run-off in the <span>Purificaci\u00f3n River basin.
