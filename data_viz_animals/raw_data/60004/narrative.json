{"name": "60004", "result": [{"species_id": 60004, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Platycypha auripes</em> occurs in forest streams of the Eastern Arc Mountains. Extent of occurrence is 16,676 km\u00b2 and area of occupancy 48 km\u00b2. It is assessed as Endangered in view of its restricted range in the East Usambara, Uluguru and Udzungwa Mts and only 5 locations with trustworthy records. The forest areas of all three mountain ranges have been largely destroyed during the last century and currently only parts of the East Usambara and the Udzungwa Mts experience some kind of protection, while at all other sides the forests are cleared or logged. The Tanzania Jewel is sensitive to forest destruction and is replaced by the Common Dancing Jewel, if the habitat is disturbed.", "geographicrange": "Endemic to the Usambara, Uluguru and Udzungwa Mountains (eastern Arc Mountains) in Tanzania. Remaining forest habitat (and hence the population) is fragmented across the known range area.", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Found in and around forest streams.", "threats": "Forest destruction, as a result of agriculture and wood extraction, in the Eastern Arc Mountains means that often only forests on hill-tops remain, where no suitable breeding habitats exist.", "conservationmeasures": "No information available but research into conservation measures, and trends/monitoring of this species would be valuable. Habitat and site-based actions are also required.", "usetrade": null}]}
