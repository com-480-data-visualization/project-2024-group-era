{"name": "196330133", "result": [{"species_id": 196330133, "taxonomicnotes": "Differences in morphological, ecological and behavioural traits suggest that the current five-species arrangement does not accurately reflect species diversity within <em>Kosciuscola</em> (Tatarnic <em>et al</em>. 2013, Umbers <em>et al</em>. 2021). Molecular work has identified species-level clades within <em>K. cuneatus</em>, with strong evidence that<em> K. cuneatus </em>proper is restricted to the Australian Capital Territory and northern New South Wales mountains (Umbers <em>et al.</em> 2021) and the remaining clades within <em>K. cuneatus </em>are undescribed species.<br/><br/>The recent emergence of major threats from climate change and bushfire, combined with the narrow ranges of these taxa as now understood, is here considered sufficient to justify assessing the reduced species concept of&#160;<em>K. cuneatus&#160;</em>pending formal publication of the forthcoming taxonomic revision, and to assess the undescribed congeners.", "rationale": "This undescribed species is listed as Endangered on the basis that it has an extent of occurrence below 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>, it occurs in fewer than five locations defined by a widespread threat from fire, and it is subject to a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat as a result of multiple threatening processes. The impact of the 2019-2020 bushfire season on the number of mature individuals in this species is unclear, but an expected increase in the frequency and severity of fires will result in a projected continuing decline in the number of mature individuals and the area of occupancy,", "geographicrange": "This undescribed species occurs in southern Victoria and Mt Buffalo, in Australia. It has been recorded between 880-1,650 m", "population": "There is no information on the population status of this species.&#160;Should the frequency and intensity of bushfires within this species' range increase as expected, then by analogy with the impacts of the 2019-2020 bushfire season on other species this grasshopper will presumably decline.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in alpine and sub-alpine meadows as well as open woodlands at lower elevations. The breeding ecology is unknown, but in common with other species in the genus it may rely on snow to protect the eggs laid in shallow ground from extreme temperatures, at least at high elevations.&#160;The adult stage needs water and desiccation of the habitat will be detrimental, but this species does not appear to be as dependent on water sources as some <em>Kosciuscola </em>species.", "threats": "Bushfires are an increasing threat to this species and almost a third (30%) of its range was impacted in the 2019-2020 bushfires, based on overlaying fire impacted areas with the known range (National Environmental Science Program unpubl. data). It will be impacted by other fire events in the future. Invasive species including foxes and feral cats prey on this the species, and horses disturb the species and degrade the habitat. Climate change is an increasing threat, causing drying of the habitat, shorter periods of snow cover and increasing bushfires. There is some disturbance within the national park from tourism. Fire management may be detrimental to this species especially if conducted in autumn.", "conservationmeasures": "This species occurs in Mt Baw Baw National Park, Alpine National Park and Avon Wilderness Park. Climate change mitigation needs to be the major focus of conservation efforts for this species. Consideration of the life cycle of this species is necessary when planning burns for bushfire management. Restoration of the habitat is needed in some areas. Minimizing development at higher elevations is recommended, as resorts are likely to exacerbate habitat loss already resulting from climate change.", "usetrade": "There is no known use of or trade in this species."}]}
