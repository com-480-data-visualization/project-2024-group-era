The species, although it has some resilience to change in the habitat, is suspected to decline by 30-40% in the next 10 years due to the impacts of the dams on their habitats and distribution. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 16,400 km<sup>2</sup> and there are four locations based on this threat. This species is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "<em>Triplophysa hazaraensis</em> is distributed in the Hazara area in Shiren and Dor rivers in Pakistan (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020). Recently it has been recorded from Malakund, Swat and Dir in Swat and Panjkora rivers (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "population": "The dams on rivers Swat and Panjkora and one planned on Shiran River are suspected to impact the population such as to cause a decline of 30-40% in the next 10 years.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "The species is carnivorous. It is not strictly benthopelagic as it can inhabit pools, runs and torrents (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "threats": "The recently constructed, under construction and planned hydroelectric dams on three of the four rivers are major threats to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation plans or actions for the species, nor are there laws to protect it.", "usetrade": "The species is not in use or trade."}]}
