The assessors are aware of records from six localities (interpreted as locations based on the most plausible threats), however five of these date from 1949; there are only recent records from one location. The species is present in one protected area: Laiwangi Wanggameti National Park. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is not likely to be particularly large. Moreover, the AOO, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, is inferred to be declining to some degree at least due to loss of habitat outside of protected areas in Sumba. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2. The species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it is to be hoped that when more data are available that reassessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Idionyx orchestra</em> is endemic to Sumba in the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia, where it is known from records scattered across the island (Irawan and Rahadi 2018, Lieftinck 1953).
