It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 3,000 km\u00b2. The population is considered to be severely fragmented as this is a rare species and the threat of sedimentation has reduced the area of and fragmented the suitable habitat. This threat is also leading to continuing declines in habitat. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Victoria. It has been recorded from Entebbe, the Victoria Nile at Jinja, Bujagali, Mengo Bay, Bugaia Island and Buvuma Island, all in Uganda. It might also occur in Kenyan and Tanzanian waters but there are no records at present.
