{"name": "157857313", "result": [{"species_id": 157857313, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to hydrothermal vents at deep ocean ridges in the Atlantic Ocean. It is currently known from two restricted locations, in the distinctive and restricted habitat of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 3,470 to 4,080 m bsl, and would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if commercial deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. The potential for anthropogenic influence at these sites based on exploration licences for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites supports a projected continuing decline in quality of habitat. There may already be disturbance to this species as ISA exploration-phase licences allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing. The impact of uncertainty around the decline in habitat means that the applicable threat level for this species ranges from VU to EN, using the recommended risk tolerance. We have opted to take a precautionary approach based on this level of uncertainty and therefore assessed the species as the top of this range, Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). <br/><br/>A reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to two locations at hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller et al. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. Locations 1 and 2 both lie beyond national jurisdiction in International Waters. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 3,470 to 4,080 m bsl. It has been observed from two vent fields: at the Snake Pit vent field (Location 1) and the Ashadze-1 vent field (Location 2) (Waren and Bouchet 2001, Fabri <em>et al.</em> 2011, Goroslavskaya and Galkin 2011). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Waren and Bouchet 2001, Fabri&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Goroslavskaya and Galkin 2011).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Atlantic Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 3,470 to 4,080 m bsl.", "threats": "Several vent fields on the Mid-Atlantic ridges lie in seabed areas under licence for exploration for polymetallic sulfide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents (Van Dover <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two exploration-phase licences for the region where the Snake Pit and Ashadze-1 vent fields are found were granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to Institut Fran\u00e7ais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer&#160;(IFREMER) and the Government of the Russian Federation, respectively, under 15-year contracts (2015-2030). The ISA exploration-phase licences allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing, hence there may already be disturbance of subpopulations. Both direct impacts from mineral extraction and indirect disturbance from adjacent activities could impact local subpopulations. Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact of these activities is uncertain. These vent fields would be susceptible to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at either vent field. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
