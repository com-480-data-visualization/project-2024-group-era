The area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 2,224 km<sup>2</sup>, close to the Vulnerable B2 threshold. Given the regional impacts of deforestation, agribusiness, effluents, and riverbed transformation, it occurs in 4-6 threat-based locations, meeting the Vulnerable subcriterion a threshold.

The species is present in creeks and rivers Orotoy, Acac\u00edas, Humea, C\u00e1queza, Gazamumo, Rucio, Garagoa, Bat\u00e1, Up\u00eda and Sunce, among others.
