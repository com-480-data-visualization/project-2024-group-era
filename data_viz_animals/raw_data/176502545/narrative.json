Within this small range, the species occurs in 4 threat-based locations and is undergoing a continuing decline in habitat quality as a result of ongoing threats due to land-use changes. As such, using the best estimate values of range calculations, this species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B1ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in tributaries to the lower Paran\u00e1 and middle Uruguay River basins in Misiones Province, Argentina (Rodriguez and Miquelarena 2005).", "population": "There is no population documentation. Research and monitoring is needed to know the population composition, structure, size and trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It inhabits small streams with swift current, rocky and sandy bottoms (Rodriguez and Miquelarena 2005). There is no information about its ecology.", "threats": "This is a rheophilic species and the major threat is land use change for small holder agriculture, wood plantations of <em>Eucalyptus </em>species, and urbanization.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no research, monitoring and planning known to be conducted for this species. Research is necessary into its population, ecology, conservation and threats.", "usetrade": "It is used in the aquarium trade, as are most <em>Rineloricaria </em>species."}]}
