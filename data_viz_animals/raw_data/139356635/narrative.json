It was described from Wuzhishan in Hainan, China, and the only other known location is in Yunnan, China, approximately 750 km from the type location. The location in Hainan is within the Wuzhishan Nature Reserve. The location in Yunnan is not far from the border with Viet Nam, so the species should also be looked for in northern Viet Nam. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its current known maximum extent of occurrence (EOO), based on the two occupied HydroBASINS areas, is 16,352 km\u00b2. The species is therefore assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Bayadera kirbyi</em> has a curious known distribution.
