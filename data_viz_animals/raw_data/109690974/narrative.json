{"name": "109690974", "result": [{"species_id": 109690974, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>The species is endemic to Lake Matano in Sulawesi, where it is only found in rocky substrate areas with an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 141 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 60 km<sup>2</sup>. This is counted as one location based on the threats of nickel mining, hydro-electric power installations, logging, and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population, which are causing a decline in habitat quality through siltation and changes to natural water levels. Most critically, this species is thought to have suffered a population decline of at least 50% in the last 10 years due predation of small adults and juveniles by invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.), because few or no individuals were observed in areas it was common in 2002-2003 (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017, 2018). An overall population decline of at least 50% is also predicted over the next 10 years due to the continued impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). Due to the suspected past decline, predicted future decline, its limited distribution and persistent threats, this species is assessed as Endangered.<br/> </p>      <p>  </p>", "geographicrange": "<p>The species&#160;is endemic to Lake Matano (164.1 km<sup>2</sup>), which is part of the Malili Lakes system in Sulawesi, Indonesia.</p>", "population": "<p>This species has previously been reported as abundant (von Rintelen <em>et al</em>. 2007), but during a recent visit (2017) to two sites in Lake Matano where it was common in 2002-2003 fewer or no individuals, respectively, were observed. This is thought to be due to invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossom</em><em>a</em> sp.) introduced to Lake Matano, which spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder<em> et al. </em>2012) and likely predated small adults and juveniles of this species (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). There is therefore thought to have been a population decline of &gt;50% over the last 10 years. An overall population decline of at least 50% is also predicted over the next 10 years due to the continued impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species occurs in the freshwater Lake Matano and is a hard substrate dweller on rocks and wood.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system.
