One of the known locations is in a protected area: Saddle Peak National Park. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, is inferred to be declining to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely between 5,000 and 10,000 km\u00b2. With as few as five confirmed locations, the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it is to be hoped that additional data will allow a reassessment to a lower threat category.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Orthetrum andamanicum</em> is endemic to the Andaman Islands (Bedjani\u010d <em>et al. </em>2020) where it is known from seven individual sites, however three of these sites are in close proximity to each other and Bedjani\u010d <em>et al. </em>(2020) consider that the species is only known from five separate locations.
