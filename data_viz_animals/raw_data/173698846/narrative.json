An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of natural habitats on Sangihe Island. Its maximum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 1,930 km\u00b2. Based on the currently available information, and taking a reasonable precautionary approach, this species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iii)). If the species proves to be able to survive in human altered habitats in the long-term it may be possible to reassess it to a less threatened category in future.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rhinocypha sangihensis</em> is only known from the type series from two locations on Sangihe Island (Sangir Besar) in the Sangihe Islands to the north of Sulawesi, collected in 1985 (van Tol and G\u00fcnther 2018).

Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
