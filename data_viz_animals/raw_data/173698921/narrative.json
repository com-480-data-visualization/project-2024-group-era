Here we consider the Takala Mountains location as presence uncertain (but very unlikely) for this species, probably it is the result of mislabeling.</p>", "rationale": "<p><em>Rhinocypha virgulata</em> is known with certainty only from the Lake Poso and Mailili Lakes areas in the central part of Sulawesi. Eight individual confirmed sites have been recorded for this species, but it is not clear if these are all really separate threat defined locations (taking clearance for agriculture as the main threat at most locations); the assessor has only been able to assign separate coordinates to six sites. The species appears to be forest-dependent, and all localities are heavily deforested. In particular, one of the confirmed locations is very close to an area which, from satellite images, has been extensively cleared of vegetation, probably for mining but possibly for agriculture, and it is doubtful that the species still occurs there. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 707\u20132,564 km\u00b2. The overall population is already likely to be severely fragmented.

(Fig. 17). The fast flowing, clear streams ranged from 2 to 10 m in width. The substrates were sandy-gravelly, rarely slightly muddy. The species was found in forested habitats or at least streams with dense gallery forests, including half-shaded streams within plantations but not in sections that were more affected by paddy fields. Probably at this time the original habitats in the open lower stream sections no longer met the habitat requirements as a result of land clearing and preparing paddy fields. The highest abundance of about 15\u201320 males per 100 m stream was observed in areas of slightly disturbed primary forests and well-developed secondary forests. At Sungai Wera the colonised section ended below the Saluopa falls. In the undisturbed rain forest section above the falls, only <em>R. phantasma</em> was found. In the 1990s, the species probably spread further into the headwaters due to progressive deforestation.\u201d.
