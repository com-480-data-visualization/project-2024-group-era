An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but based on the available data the AOO will be less than 500km<sup>2</sup> and will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. If the species is genuinely confined to Palawan he extent of occurrence (EOO) will also be sharply constrained and based only on the known locations would be below 5,000km<sup>2</sup>. In most circumstances this assessor would place such a poorly known species in Data Deficient, but it is likely to have a restricted range Palawan and given that there is ongoing loss of and alteration to all original lowland habitats in the region it is unlikely that the species will qualify for Least Concern when more information is available, a Data Deficient assessment is not appropriate. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Stenagrion petermilleri</em> is only known from two locations in Palawan in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 1997, Villanueva <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species occurs in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area which may gain protected status and might occur in the nearby Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but based on the available data the AOO will be less than 500km<sup>2</sup> and will be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. If the species is genuinely confined to Palawan the extent of occurrence (EOO) will be sharply constrained (the area of Palawan is only approximately 12,189km<sup>2</sup>) and based only on the known locations would be below 5,000km<sup>2</sup>.</p>", "population": "<p>All that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of lowland forest in Palawan and its satellite Islands and that severe fragmentation is likely for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (1997: 475): \u201cThe damselfly was spotted hanging in moist grass below a mossy vertical 4-5 m high rock, near a small waterfall, at an elevation of ca 100-200 m. The habitat was very dark and misty.\u201d The closely related <em>Stenagrion dubium</em> from Borneo occurs at forest streams, usually in steep terrain and is often found at waterfalls, it is likely that <em>S. petermilleri</em> occupies similar habitats. It is also likely that the species occupies a much wider altitudinal range than is currently known and it might even be commoner in montane forest than in the lowlands. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation resulting from agriculture and logging. BirdLife International (2019, but based on information from 2001) note (for Palawan in general) that \u201cSmall-scale timber extraction and well-organised logging operations are hastening the depletion of the forest cover on the island\u201d, this is despite the fact that the entire island is a Biosphere reserve.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more information on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Total protection of Cleopatra\u2019s Needle is highly desirable. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
