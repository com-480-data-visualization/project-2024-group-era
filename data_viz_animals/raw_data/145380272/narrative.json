{"name": "145380272", "result": [{"species_id": 145380272, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from two restricted locations, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 1447 m to 3680&#160;m bsl. As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted AOO, and has been found at two locations, the plausible threat of future anthropogenic influence from deep-sea mining in these sites justifies the assessment of the species as VU D2. Whilst no licenses have been granted to date, if mining were to be approved within the USA EEZ, the projected decline in the extent and quality of habitat would drive this species to CR very rapidly. Therefore, an urgent reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining license arrangements or if there are future changes to the prices of relevant commodities, whereby the assessment would probably increase to EN B2ab(iii).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>", "geographicrange": "<p>This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to two locations covering four hydrothermal vent fields in the Mariana Back-Arc Basin, West Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.</p><p>Both Locations 1 and 2 are within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States of America. The species is currently known from four hydrothermal vent fields with active black smokers and diffuse venting located at depths of 1447 m to 3680&#160;m bsl, namely the Alice Springs vent field (in Location 1) and the Snail, Forecast, and Pika vent fields (in Location 2) (Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).

The exploitation of polymetallic&#160;sulfide&#160;mineral resources, which&#160;form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. Polymetallic sulfide resource exploration can include some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation phases, hence there may already be&#160;disturbance&#160;of the subpopulation. Evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller<em> et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain. These vent field may be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted.</p><p></p><p></p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are no conservation actions currently in place at any West Pacific vent fields, however, further research is recommended to determine whether the populations would be susceptible to disturbance by mining, to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites, and to ascertain the dispersal capability for this species, as these will assist in re-evaluation of the conservation status of the species. Development of protocols to minimise sediment plume creation by those investigating the sea-bed habitats during exploration for mineral would be beneficial for all species in these sensitive habitats.&#160;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
