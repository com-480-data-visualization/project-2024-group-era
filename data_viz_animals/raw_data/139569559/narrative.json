An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in northern Luzon. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) is less than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>.
