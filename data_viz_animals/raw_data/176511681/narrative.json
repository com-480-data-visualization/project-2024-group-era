{"name": "176511681", "result": [{"species_id": 176511681, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is distributed in seasonal wetlands of Lower Parana and  Lower Uruguay ecoregions, and Atlantic coastal basins in Argentina. The area of occupancy (AOO) is 36 km<sup>2</sup>. Threats not only in close proximity to the habitat, but also those that are present in the same hydrological basin (especially those upstream), were considered and include forestation and desiccation of wetlands to prevent flooding and to gain area for soy and rice crops. There are three locations, and continuing declines in extent of occurrence (EOO), AOO and habitat based on these threats. As a result, this species is listed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is distributed in Argentina and Uruguay in seasonal wetlands of Lower Parana and Lower Uruguay ecoregions, and Atlantic coastal basins.<br/><br/>Distributional data on this species are very detailed, based on  intensive and extensive field sampling (from 1998-2015), and a bibliographical revision (Alonso <em>et al. </em>2016).", "population": "There is no information on the population trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The habitat for&#160;<em>Austrolebias </em><em>elongatus</em>, as in other annual   fishes of the genus, is flatland seasonal ponds that remain dry on average for four months (from late spring to autumn, in the southern hemisphere). Dry conditions are necessary for successful   embryo development and viability (Berois<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014). Soils   with high percentage of clay seem to be the best for egg deposition. The   minimum wet period for individuals to reach maturity and reproduce is   around two months; reproduction is continuous from adulthood to death   (Berois&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Ponds   may be filled by rains or adjacent stream floods. Adults are found in a   wide range of water temperatures from 6\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C, but higher   temperatures could reduce survival. <em>Austrolebias </em>species feeds on aquatic and   terrestrial invertebrates (microcrustaceans, oligochaetes, insect   larvae, arachnids, etc.) (Laufer <em>et al.</em> 2009). Potential predators are larger fish   species, insect larvae, aquatic snakes and birds.", "threats": "Threats for&#160;<em>Austrolebias elongatus</em> are:&#160;<br/><ol><li>Annual &amp; perennial non-timber crops. The distribution of this species is in areas used for soy crops.&#160;&#160;</li><li>Fishing &amp; harvesting aquatic resources. Annual fishes are very popular in the pet trade, and national regulations of collecting activities are not tight.&#160;&#160;</li><li>Nutrient loads. Soy crops use high quantities of fertilisers that may cause eutrophication in seasonal ponds.&#160;</li><li>Herbicides and pesticides. Soy crops use high quantities of these substances that may reduce subpopulation viability (Zebral <em>et al.</em> 2018)</li><li>Urbanization. This desiccates seasonal wetlands.&#160;</li><li>Droughts. Considering global climate change predictions, severe droughts for more than two consecutive years may eliminate subpopulations of annual fishes. &#160;&#160;</li><li>Storms &amp; flooding. Annual fish embryos need a brief period (time unknown) of drought to normally complete their development. Floods in spring and summer may negatively affect embryos viability.&#160;&#160;</li></ol>", "conservationmeasures": "Conservation actions recommended are:<ol><li>Improve national legislation and infrastructure to control harvesting (fishing).</li><li>Create protected areas considering the distribution of all subpopulations of this species.&#160;</li><li>Create and promote safe agricultural practices that avoid desiccation, eutrophication and pollution of seasonal ponds and wetlands.</li></ol>Wetlands in Uruguay are supposedly protected by law, but this is not always implemented. All <em>Austrolebias </em>species  are considered priorities for the National Protected Areas System, but  few species (or few localities) are protected within such areas.", "usetrade": "This species is used as a pet.<em> Austrolebias&#160;</em>species are subject of research in developmental biology, ecology, and evolution (Berois <em>et al.</em> 2015)."}]}
