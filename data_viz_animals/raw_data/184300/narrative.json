{"name": "184300", "result": [{"species_id": 184300, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Neodythemis munyaga has been described recently. It is only known from several individuals from the type locality in Uganda in the Bwindi National Park (Munyaga valley). The known location in Bwindi National Park is relatively well protected, but the surrounding habitat is highly degraded. The increasing human population increases the destruction of potentially suitable habitats outside the National Park and also encroachment in the National Park. The species might occur in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, though more surveys are needed to confirm this. Based on the small area of occupancy and extent of occurrence it is assessed as Endangered. Further surveys are necessary to check, whether the species is really range restricted.", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from Uganda (Bwindi National Park in Buhoma, Munyaga Valley) and is likely to also occur in the Democratic Republic of Congo.", "population": "Population size is unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Forest streams.", "threats": "No information available.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures known but information on taxonomy, population ecology, habitat status and population trends would be valuable.", "usetrade": null}]}
