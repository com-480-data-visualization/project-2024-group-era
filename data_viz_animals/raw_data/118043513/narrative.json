{"name": "118043513", "result": [{"species_id": 118043513, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 7,312 km<sup>2</sup> and a known area of occupancy (AOO) of 12 km<sup>2</sup>. It was recently discovered, which suggests that the AOO might increase with more sampling effort. There is continuing decline in habitat inferred based on the presence of logging activities and illegal gold mines within the distribution area. There is insufficient information to count threat-based locations. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is known from the Guiana Shield. It is present in the rivers Ventuari and Manapiare, upper Orinoco drainage, in Amazonas state.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate the population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is present in rivers, streams and creeks of clear waters and moderately acidic waters (Armbruster and Lujan 2016).", "threats": "The main threats come from the deforestation of tropical and riparian forests, which cover the habitats of this species, for the trade of wood and the establishment of gold mines (Oliveira-Miranda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). One illegal gold mine in Parucito River (Sanchez 2015) is within the species' distribution area, suggesting that the species is experiencing habitat loss and degradation.", "conservationmeasures": "Nearly 30% of this species' distribution occurs within the natural monuments of Cuao-Sipapo, Serran\u00eda de Yutaj\u00e9 and Cerro Camani. However, there are several gold mines near these areas, so this measure alone might not be sufficient to guarantee the protection of this species.", "usetrade": "This species is collected and traded as an ornamental fish, but there are no records about harvest rates, areas of collections, fishing methods, or average lengths of capture. It is also bred outside of Venezuela and commercialized as an ornamental fish. Trade in this species is not regulated by any law."}]}
