An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available information but based on the available data it will be below 500km<sup>2</sup>. The AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are all inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of lowland forest in the area where the species occurs; this is based on the assumption that the species, like the others in its genus, is forest-dependent. With no definite information on habitat requirements and only one location known it could be argued that this species should be assessed as Data Deficient, but it is likely to have a restricted range in the northwest of Mindanao and given that there is ongoing loss of and alteration to all original lowland habitats in the region it is unlikely that the species will qualify for Least Concern when more information is available, a Data Deficient assessment is not appropriate. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criterion B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Sangabasis zamboanga</em> is known only from the holotype from Mount Dapiak in Mindanao and another specimen without location data (Villanueva &amp; Dow 2014).

Protection of areas including populations of the species is also required, e.g. the Mount Dapiak-Mount Paraya Important Bird Area. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
