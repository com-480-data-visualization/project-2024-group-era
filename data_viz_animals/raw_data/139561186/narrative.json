An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is likely to be small and will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest throughout Samar. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by the area of Samar and based on the available data is below 5,000 km\u00b2. It is believed that the overall population is already severely fragmented. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and, taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, is assessed accordingly. When more data are available it is to be hoped that re-assessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Igneocnemis kaiseri </em>is only known from Samar in the Philippines (Gassmann and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2002). The assessor is aware of records from 6-7 locations but it has only been possible to assign coordinates to six of these for mapping purposes. It might be present in the Calbayog Pan-as\u2013Hayiban Protected Landscape which is not far from one of the known locations and is likely to be present in two (non-protected) Important Bird Areas (IBA) on Samar, the Mount Cabalantian - Mount Capoto-an complex and the Mount Yacgun - Mount Sohoton complex and might be present within the Sohoton Natural Bridge Natural Park within the latter IBA. Additionally the entirety of Samar is apparently a Natural Park but this does not seem to have any practical value. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is likely to be small and will be declining due to loss and degradation of forest throughout Samar. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by the area of Samar (approximately 13,429 km\u00b2); the EOO calculation, based on a minimum convex polygon around the mapped data points, is 3,983 km\u00b2.<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"></p>", "population": "<p>This species appears to be very local in occurrence, but can be moderately common where it does occur.
