{"name": "118039106", "result": [{"species_id": 118039106, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is listed as Vulnerable, in view of its extent of occurrence (EOO) of 6,303 km<sup>2 </sup>and its area of occupancy (AOO) of 32 km<sup>2</sup>, with all observed individuals in six threat-based locations and a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat related to deforestation and pollution from illegal mining activities.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from the Guiana Shield. It has been collected in the upper Caura Basin, in the Erebato, Tabaro, Kakada and Suajadito rivers, the streams Suajaditu and Kushime, and in the main channel of the Caura.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate the population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It inhabits the margins of streams with rocky and sandy bottoms in acidic waters tainted with tannins (Nijssen and Isbr\u00fccker 1982).", "threats": "The entire area where this species is distributed is represented by tropical and riparian forests threatened because of log extraction and gold mining (Oliveira-Miranda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). One illegal gold mine (Las Pavas) occurs in the species distribution area and several mines in the upper Yuruani River (Sanchez 2015) are at 9 km upstream of the southern limits, affecting the species through habitat loss and degradation.", "conservationmeasures": "Around 20% of its population occurs within Cerro Maigualida Natural Monument. However, this represents only a small proportion of the species distribution area. Besides, the presence of illegal gold mines in this natural monument suggests that this measure alone is not sufficient to guarantee the conservation of the species.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is utilized for human consumption or traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
