An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, however, unless the species is severely under-recorded the AOO is unlikely to be particularly large and is inferred to be declining due to drainage of and pollution of wetlands within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is much greater than the threshold for criterion B1 (EOO = 519,798\u2013541,545 km\u00b2). Despite its large EOO, there is cause for concern over this species, and a Least Concern assessment is not justified with the currently available data. The species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2 because of the small number of locations, and plausible threats from drainage and pollution of wetlands which may cause this species to become Critically Endangered or Extinct within a short time frame. If its AOO could be sensible calculated, this species might also qualify as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that more information will enable reassessment to a lower threat category in the future.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cyclogomphus ypsilon</em> is known from five definite locations, widely scattered across a large part of India (Dawn and Chandra 2014, Fraser 1934, Rathod <em>et al</em>. 2016).
