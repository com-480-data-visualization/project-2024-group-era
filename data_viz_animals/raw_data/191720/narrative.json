Its historically known distribution encompasses the endorheic R\u00edo Grande de Morelia drainage including the Lago Cuitzeo and the Presa Cointzio&#160;and several affluents of the lake and the river as well as springs (manantiales San Cristob\u00e1l&#160;and La Mintzita). Furthermore it could be found in the&#160;Laguna Yur\u00edr\u00eda, the&#160;Lago Zacap\u00fa and the R\u00edo Angulo, the Middle R\u00edo Lerma&#160;and habitats along the R\u00edo Turbio, Middle R\u00edo Lerma drainage. It has been extirpated from the R\u00edo Lerma and possibly from the R\u00edo Turbio drainage as well as from the Laguna Yurir\u00eda.

While they are quite moderate in the springs (e.g. La Mintzita), the numbers within the Cuitzeo lake fluctuate according to the season. An increasing water level and food availability in fall leads to an increase in numbers, while a sinking water level, droughts and the increasing number of fishing birds (Egrets, Pelicans) over the winter period brings the numbers down.<br/><br/>The R\u00edo Angulo subpopulation is restricted to few habitats, but it is at least quite numerous in the Zacap\u00fa lake.&#160;<br/><br/>The Middle R\u00edo Lerma subpopulation occurred in habitats of the &#160;R\u00edo Lerma as well as the R\u00edo Turbio until about 2015, mainly next to San Francisco del Rinc\u00f3n and Abasolo. All of the known location points have been surveyed by K\u00f6ck<em> et al. </em>during two surveys in 2017, but were inconclusive. Though the habitats did look suitable, the species couldn't be found.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This freshwater species is known to inhabit lakes, streams, ponds, canals and ditches over  substrates of clay, silt, mud, sand, gravel, decayed organic matter&#160;and  rocks. It prefers clear to muddy water with little to moderate currents and&#160;can be found in depths of less than 1 m, usually less than 0.6 m,  preferring areas with dense vegetation including green algae, <em>Eichhornia</em>, <em>Scirpus</em>, <em>Potamogeton</em>, <em>Nasturtium</em>, <em>Chara</em> and <em>Lemna</em> (Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). The Picotee Splitfin is, like all representatives of the genus <em>Zoogoneticus</em>, a predator feeding from small invertebrates. <br/><br/>La Mintzita is a marshy spring-fed lake of about 80 m diameter that drains into the R\u00edo Grande de Morelia and hence into the Lago Cuitzeo. The R\u00edo Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo basin is endorheic, although its fauna indicates that it was once connected to the adjacent R\u00edo Lerma basin. Most of the R\u00edo Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo system has been greatly degraded, and La Mintzita is one of the last remaining high-quality sites in the basin. A few hundred metres below the lake, the outlet canal receives wastes from a large paper mill (Bio Papel Scribe S.A. de C.V.) and no longer has the capability to support fish life, so La Mintzita is isolated from other fish populations in the basin. Lyons<em>&#160;</em>(2004) sampled the outlet canal just below the lake with a backpack electroshocker and the lake itself just above the outlet with a seine. The canal was about 8 m wide and 0.5-1 m deep with a fast strong current and gravel bottom. In 80 m of sampling, they collected the following Goodeids: 3&#160;<em>Alloophrous robustus</em>, 30&#160;<em>Goodea atripinnis</em>, about 100&#160;<em>Xenotoca&#160;</em>cf.&#160;<em>variata</em>, 5&#160;<em>Skiffia lermae</em>, and about 15&#160;<em>Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis</em>. Lyons&#160;(2004) also caught 10&#160;<em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>&#160;(Poeciliidae; native) and about 25&#160;<em>Xiphophorus helleri</em>&#160;(an exotic Poeciliid), plus 10&#160;<em>Yuriria alta</em>&#160;(Cyprinidae; native) and 10&#160;<em>Scartomyzon austrinus</em>. They then pulled the seine over about 300m<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the lake, which averaged about 1 m deep with a sand and clay bottom and clear water at 15-19 \u00b0C temperature. They captured 3&#160;<em>A. robustus</em>, 5&#160;<em>G. atripinnis</em>, 30&#160;<em>X.&#160;</em>cf.&#160;<em>variata</em>, about 100&#160;<em>S. lermae</em>, 3&#160;<em>Z. quitzeoensis</em>, plus at least 1,000&#160;<em>P. infans</em>, 5&#160;<em>X. helleri</em>, and 30&#160;<em>Y. alta</em>&#160;(Lyons 2004).<br/><br/>The Cuitzeo lake is the oldest and second largest Mexican lake and covers an area of about 500 km<sup>2</sup> including the marshy grass surrounding it. It is irregularly shaped with northern, western and eastern sections, connected by marshland in the middle. The western section is divided into an east and a west part by two north-south dams. The lake is astatic and very shallow (about 0.5 m deep), with muddy ground and murky water. In dry years, the west part of the western section is completely isolated from the eastern part by closing the passages under the roads to save the western section from drying. With this method, at least the eastern part of the western section keeps water. The lake is surrounded by partly dense and large reed areas. In reed areas directly at the dam, K\u00f6ck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;were able to find many specimens on a survey in November 2014, but few in January 2015.<br/><br/>The Lago Zacap\u00fa is an irregular shaped small lagoon with an extension from the northwest to the southwest, length about 670, width about 470 m. In the southwest corner of the lake begins the dammed outlet, extending east-northeast upward over a length of about 800 m and 60 m wide over the whole length. The outlet ends with a southwards bent hook with an extension of 150 x 90 m. After the dam, the affluent of the Canal or R\u00edo Angulo begins and merges into it after about 6.5 km. K\u00f6ck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) found the species in good numbers on two sites of the lagoon in shallow water between dense roots and foliage of willow trees (<em>Salix</em>&#160;species). The water was, at one place, greenish brown but clear with little current and partly shaded by trees, in the other place, brownish to clear with little to no current too. Other species found at the first spot were&#160;<em>Skiffia lermae</em>,&#160;<em>Xenotoca variata</em>,&#160;<em>Goodea atripinnis</em>,&#160;<em>Allotoca zacapuensis&#160;</em>and<em>&#160;Hubbsina turneri. </em>At the second site, the same species were found except for the Zacap\u00fa Allotoca. <br/><br/>The Lago Zacap\u00fa is fed by approximately 20 cold water springs (19 \u00b0C), which emerge at the southwestern end of the valley of Zacap\u00fa, some of which are used for human consumption and recreation (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1465, 2004). With the confluence of fish species, migratory birds, plants and endemic amphibians (<em>Ambystoma andersoni</em>), it can be considered as a broad transitional zone, giving it great ecological importance. Two main sections of Lago Zacap\u00fa differ, one with of depths between 4 to 6 m, and the other ranging from 12 to 90 m deep, bedded by soils and alluvium (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1465, 2004).<br/><br/>The Middle R\u00edo Lerma subpopulation occurred besides the R\u00edo Lerma in some habitats along the R\u00edo Turbio until about 2015, mainly next to San Francisco del Rinc\u00f3n and Abasolo. All of the known location points have been surveyed by K\u00f6ck<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>during two surveys in 2017, but were inconclusive. Though the habitats did look suitable, the species couldn't be ascertained. One habitat (a creek northwest of San Francisco del Rinc\u00f3n), revealed many introduced&#160;<em>Poeciliopsis gracilis</em>&#160;and Tilapia, but only a few native fish (<em>Goodea atripinnis, Xenotoca variata, Poeciliopsis infans</em>). The second, a dammed pond west of Abasolo, housed native&#160;<em>Neotoca bilineata</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>, but besides that, only Tilapia.", "threats": "The species is threatened by water pollution, competition through invasive species and desiccation of river courses due to over-extraction of water resources and climate change (Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez <em>et al</em>. 2008). Genetic erosion related with human perturbations of this species  was demonstrated  recently (Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez <em>et al</em>. 2007). In the Lago Cuitzeo, it is threatened mainly through droughts, which are becoming more severe through changing climate in combination with the number of competitors for food (juvenile Tilapia) and predators over the winter time (migratory fishing birds). In the La Mintzita spring, over exploitation of water leads to a decreasing water quality. In addition, juvenile Tilapia, and other introduced fish (namely Swordtails and Guppys), are competitors for food. Nutrients, sediments and the increasing use of the Zacap\u00fa lake for recreation, threaten the species within the R\u00edo Angulo drainage. The same goes for the nearby habitat at Tarejero.<br/><br/>In the creek northwest of San Francisco del Rinc\u00f3n, there were many introduced&#160;<em>Poeciliopsis gracilis</em>&#160;and Tilapia, but only few native fish (<em>Goodea atripinnis, Xenotoca variata, Poeciliopsis infans</em>). The second, a dammed pond west of Abasolo, contains native&#160;<em>Neotoca bilineata</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Poeciliopsis infans </em>in addition to&#160;Tilapia. Therefore, this subpopulation is like the Laguna Yurir\u00eda subpopulation: regarded Possibly Extinct.", "conservationmeasures": "La Mintzita is a reservoir formed by a series of springs that is protected by the Ramsar convention (Number 1919, Designated 2009).
