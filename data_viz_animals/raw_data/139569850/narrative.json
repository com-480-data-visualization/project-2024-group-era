An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in northern Luzon. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) is less than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) but it is to be hoped that when more data are available from northern Luzon re-assessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Sulcosticta pallida</em> is endemic to Luzon in the Philippines (van Tol 2005). The assessor is aware of records from five locations in the north of the island but it has not been possible to assign coordinates to one of these for mapping purposes. Based on the known locations the species might be present in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park or Mount Pulag National Park, but this requires confirmation. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and will be declining as a result of loss and degradation of forest in northern Luzon. The extent of occurrence (EOO) calculated using http://geocat.kew.org is 1,066.594 km<sup>2</sup> and although this is likely to be an underestimate, with the available data there is no reason to assume that the EOO is greater than 5,000km<sup>2</sup>.</p>", "population": "<p>All that can be said with the available data is that some decline in overall population will be occurring as a result of clearance of forest throughout the range of the species and that severe fragmentation is likely for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This will be a species of forest streams but no details are known. The extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred to be declining due to loss of and disturbance to forest in northeast Luzon.</p>", "threats": "<p>Threats from clearance of forest for agriculture, logging and mining exist throughout the range of this species, even within protected areas. For instance in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park, where this species might occur, Villanueva <em>et al. </em>(2009: 72) state: \u201cLogging, agricultural encroachment, the use of destructive fishing and hunting methods, and the conversion of wetlands form major threats to the biodiversity of the protected area. Government plans for infrastructural development and mining could have a severe impact on the park\u201d.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance and, if not present in existing protected areas, for the protection of habitat where it does occur. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
