Extent of Occurrence is estimated to be 6,530 km<sup>2</sup> and it is likely that this species occurs at less than 10 locations. Existing&#160;threats include habitat degradation associated with land use changes, urban pollution, and agricultural runoff. While there is currently no indication of major population decline resulting from these potential threats, they continue to produce inferred declines in habitat quality and potentially availability.

Given inclusion within two protected areas (Monfredi 2012, F\u00fcreder <em>et al</em>. 2014), but demonstrated and pervasive threats throughout this species range including deforestation and land conversion, this species is inferred to occur in 3-10 locations. </p>", "population": "<p>Total population size and population trend are unknown. This species was common at lower and intermediate reaches in Corcovado National Park (Constantz and Bussing 1981, Monfredi 2012).

Additionally, widespread deforestation has resulted in increased sedimentation rates within the Terraba River basin (Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2018). Agricultural discharge (primary from palm oil plantations) continues to result in additional nutrient loading, herbicide and pesticide introduction, and sedimentation (Rojas and Rodr\u00edguez 2008). Completion of the proposed Boruca dam is likely to have major ecological impacts on the hydrology of the T\u00e9rraba River basin (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  While the scope and magnitude of these impacts are unknown, they continue to result in inferred declines in habitat quality and potentially availability.", "conservationmeasures": "<p>This species is known from multiple protected areas, including Piedra Blanca and Corcovado National Parks (Monfredi 2012, F\u00fcreder <em>et al</em>. 2014, IUCN and UNEP 2019).
