{"name": "176163641", "result": [{"species_id": 176163641, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is narrowly endemic in the upper Potaro River drainage, where illegal gold mining is known to occur. Gold mining activities are extremely damaging to aquatic ecosystems and are leading to a continuing decline in the habitat, number of locations and population size. The population is suspected to have declined by 30% in the past 10 years as a result of this threat. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 6,581 km<sup>2 </sup>and the area of occupancy (AOO) best estimated at under 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. There are seven locations based on the threat of mining. This species is evaluated as Vulnerable", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Potaro River drainage, Essequibo River Basin, Guyana. The type locality is Erukin, Guyana.", "population": "The population is decreasing because the Potaro River habitats continue to degrade because of sedimentation and destruction of benthic habitats by gold dredges. A population reduction of 30% is suspected over the last 10 years.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species is found in forest streams and rivers. Water has high transparency, is tea-colored, low in pH, very low in dissolved minerals. Substrate is sand and organic material such as leaf pack and branches. Reproduction is oviparous, with parents providing care for eggs and fry.", "threats": "No specific threat data are available, but this species is being impacted by gold mining.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no specific conservation measures protecting this species. It occurs in Kaieteur National Park in Guyana.", "usetrade": "This species is in the international ornamental fish trade."}]}
