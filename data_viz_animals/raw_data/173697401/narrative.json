Given that relatively little other forest remains in the same part of south Viet Nam, and most of that at higher elevations, it is possible that the species is confined to Cat Tien National Park. Its area of occupancy (AOO) is likely smaller than the total area of Cat Tien National Park (720 km\u00b2) and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely &lt;5,000 km\u00b2. Given that threats from encroachment and illegal logging have been listed for Cat Tien, the AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Although only one or two locations are known, given the threats that appear to be present, Data Deficient is not an appropriate assessment for this species. Taking a reasonable precautionary approach, the species is assessed as Endangered status under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that when additional data become available, it will be possible to reassess the species in a less threatened category.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Sundaeschna cattienensis</em> is only known from the type series, consisting of two males collected on the same day in 2010, from Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam (Kiyoshi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Kiyoshi <em>et al. </em>(2018) do not give details of the locations within Cat Tien where the specimens were collected, but they must be from one or at most two threat-defined locations. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. Given that relatively little other forest remains in the same part of south Viet Nam, and most of that at higher elevations, it is possible that the species is confined to Cat Tien National Park. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, Cat Tien National Park has an area of 720 km\u00b2; if the species is confined to this national park, then its AOO and extent of occurrence (EOO) are both likely to be smaller than 720 km\u00b2 (likely significantly smaller). Even if it occurs at other lowland forest sites in the same area, the EOO is likely to be below 5,000 km\u00b2. Its AOO is almost certain to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species.</p>", "population": "<p>If the range of this species extends beyond Cat Tien National Park then both severe fragmentation and an ongoing decline in overall population is suspected due to loss and fragmentation of lowland forest in southern Viet Nam.

There is no information on the breeding habitat of the species but it certainly appears to be forest-dependent. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest outside of Cat Tien National Park.</p>", "threats": "<p>Hypothetical populations outside of Cat Tien National Park will be threatened by conversion of forest for agriculture and logging. There may be threats even with the National Park, according to a Wikipedia entry (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1t_Ti%C3%AAn_National_Park#Threats\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1t_Ti%C3%AAn_National_Park#Threats</a>; accessed 27 November 2019), the park is threatened by encroachment by local communities and illegal logging. BirdLife International (2019, based on data compiled in 2002) state \u201cForest land along the northern boundary of Nam Cat Tien is being converted into agricultural land, reducing the area of habitat for globally threatened species. This is of particular concern for the important wetlands and grasslands which lie close to the northern boundary. Illegal exploitation of timber, rattan, mammals, birds and fish is still taking place within Nam Cat Tien. Land within Nam Cat Tien designated as agricultural land is not under the management of the national park management board, which only controls land designated as forest land. Poor coordination among different local government agencies is resulting in an emphasis on agricultural development instead of biodiversity conservation in the agricultural land within the site.\u201d</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more data on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance, and for the elimination of threats within Cat Tien National Park (if still present). Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
