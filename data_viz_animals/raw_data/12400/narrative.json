However, it is restricted to subterranean karst ecosystems in the south-central region of the Artemisa and Mayabeque provinces in western Cuba (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda <em>et al.</em> 2012), and specifically around the towns of Artemisa, Alqu\u00edzar, G\u00fcira de Melena and Quivic\u00e1n (Garc\u00eda-Debr\u00e1s <em>et al</em>. 1999). It has been reported from a total of 22 collection localities but more recently confirmed from 13 localities (Garc\u00eda-Debr\u00e1s <em>et al</em>. 1999, Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). &#160;</p>  <p>Based on georeferenced collection records (E.

The number of threat-based locations where <em>L. subterranea</em> occurs is estimated to be 3-4, based on the introduction of non-native fish species, water usage, and the hydrologic connectivity of occupied habitat and the pervasive threat of saltwater intrusion in southern areas.</p><p></p>", "population": "<p>Total population size has not been estimated but is suspected to be small, given a restricted geographic range and low reported abundances in visual censuses (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Early last century 156 (82 female and 74 males) specimens were sampled between March 1902 and June 1905 (Eigenmann 1909). About 50 more have been sampled during the latest decades (Hern\u00e1ndez <em>et al</em>. 2020). Population trend is unknown. Genetic diversity within existing subpopulations suggests limited genetic exchange and small effective population sizes (Garc\u00eda-Machado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Previous visual surveys suggest that this species accounts for a smaller proportion of relative abundance when compared to its sympatric congener <em>L. dentata</em> (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Successive collections at a single locality over a few months resulted in diminishing returns, which suggests that populations are highly susceptible to short periods of rapid decline and that immigration from underground habitat not subject to sampling effort is limited (Eigenmann 1909). The highest reported abundances of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. seem to occur in caves with large colonies of bats, where food resources are relatively high (Garc\u00eda-Debr\u00e1s and P\u00e9rez 1999), though some relationship with the twilight zones of cave entrances has also been suggested (Eigenmann 1909).</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p></p><p>The available knowledge about the ecology of the Cuban species of <em>Lucifuga</em> ssp. is limited. This cryptic, troglobitic cusk-eel is the species typical of the genus and occurs in karst systems of Artemisa and Mayabeque provinces in western Cuba to a depth of approximately 30 meters (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Trajano 2001). It occurs primarily in flooded caves that are connected to surface influences through sinkholes and natural wells (Eigenmann 1909). These caves typically exhibit lentic conditions with translucent waters that are high in magnesium and salts from lime dissolution (Eigenmann 1909). The cave environment is characterized by stable seasonal abiotic conditions and temperatures of approximately 25 \u00b0C (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).<em> </em>The water level remains almost unchanged throughout the year (Eigenmann 1909). However, in recent decades, drastic fluctuations in the water table have been observed (e.g. Cueva El Tunel) as a consequence of dry periods and intense water use for agriculture and human consumption.<em> </em>The diet of this opportunistic forager is comprised largely of crustaceans, including troglobitic shrimps but probably also mysid shrimps, amphipods, isopods, and insects (Eigenmann 1909). This species is often found sympatrically with the congener <em>L. dentata</em> (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The habitat that this species occupies is highly susceptible to abiotic alterations (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Specific life history data for this species are lacking, but &#160;reproduction is likely characterized by low fecundity and a long generation length (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. are viviparous, and several pregnant females of <em>L. subterranea</em> bearing 2-15 embryos were analyzed by Eigenmann (1909). In some cases, the young size was 2.0-2.5 cm in length. No breeding season is known for this species although March to May was suggested as most probable (Eigenmann 1909). Maximum reported body size is 8.95 cm standard length (SL) (Hern\u00e1ndez <em>et al</em>. 2020).</p>  <p>Surface fish species have been introduced into or have naturally invaded some localities of Artemisa and Agramonte regions. <em>Girardinus metallicus</em> was reported at Ashton early last century (Eigenmann 1909), while <em>Xiphophorus</em>, <em>Poecilia</em>, and <em>Plecostomus</em> sp. have also been observed.</p><br/><p></p>", "threats": "<p></p><p>The primary threats to this species include the intensive use of subterranean water, the introduction of non-native species, contamination with domestic and non-degradable solid wastes (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hern\u00e1ndez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Galford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), and increased instances of industrial pollutants (Sosa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Guzm\u00e1n-Morales&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), which have the potential to drastically alter subterranean habitat stability with only small changes in abiotic conditions (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). These threats are producing estimated continuous declines in the number of mature individuals and the number of subpopulations, and inferred continuous declines in habitat quality and availability.</p>  <p>Solid waste pollution (e.g., nylon and polystyrene tires) and translocated Poeciliids have been documented within the Aston Cave system and Luis Piedra Cave, which accounts for several collection localities (Ponce de Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). </p>  <p>Saltwater inundation of karst aquifers resulting from rising sea level, land subsidence, and aquifer overdrafts is likely to have affected several caves occupied by this species and its close congeners. Ground and surface water extraction for agricultural and domestic use has resulted in the salinization of many of Cuba\u2019s karst aquifers (Castillo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Specific examples of salinization are apparent in the G\u00fcira-Quivic\u00e1n basin (e.g. Cajio region where the type locality of <em>L. subterranean </em>occurs) on the southern plane of Havana (Castillo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).
