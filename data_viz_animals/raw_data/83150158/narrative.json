Currently, it is a common species there with stable populations. Despite this it is assessed as Vulnerable, because a single event (e.g. water pollution, drought or storm) may bring the species to the brink of extinction.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Pohnpei Island, Federal States of Micronesia.", "population": "This species is abundant on the island and the populations are considered stable.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "Paulson and Buden (2003) report this species as an inhabitant of fast-flowing rocky streams. Most often it perches on rocks along the stream bank and in midstream. Pairs are common ovipositing in tandem.", "threats": "There are no observable threats to this species, although deforestation probably represents a threat, as most populations are  found in forested areas. Two-thirds of lowland native forest was lost  between 1975 and 1995.  There is continued rain-forest clearing at a  slow rate and this may represent a threat over time to both terrestrial  and aquatic habitats of this species. Being restricted to a single, small oceanic island, the species is also vulnerable to stochastic events (e.g. drought or storms).", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures in place for this species.", "usetrade": null}]}
