{"name": "60287", "result": [{"species_id": 60287, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Most of the originally known populations (see map) are extinct (last survey 2014) and the decline is expected to continue due to stream drying, which may be due to climatic fluctuations combined with human use for agricultural purposes. In Algeria, many previously known populations are extinct due to heavy stream pollution. The whole range is extremely fragmented (known localities are a small area in Tunisia, a recent record in Algeria, and an area in Morocco: total area of occupancy (AOO) according to the IUCN criteria is 56 km\u00b2, but the actual area that this species occupies is less than 10 km\u00b2). The species may be relatively mobile, but more studies are required to confirm distance travelled by individuals. Based on its restricted AOO, severe fragmentation and continuing declines it is assessed as Endangered under criterion B.<br/><br/>Almost all localities exhibit only a low density and many in Morocco and Tunisia have recently declined due to stream pollution and drying during summer, in connection to agricultural practices, irrigation, water harnessing and domestic discharge. The total population is presently is estimated to be far less than 10,000 imagoes. Nearly 80% (which closely meets criteria A) of the overall localities have been lost by within the last 100 years, and this will certainly continue in the future, owing to demographic expansion in the Maghreb [x2.5 in Morocco, x3.1 in Algeria and x2.3 in Tunisia from 1961 to 2003 (FAO 2004-2005)] and global climatic changes. A decline of at least 10% is expected within the next 10 years. The AOO of pre-2000 records was 104 km\u00b2, while this has nearly halved within the last 10 years to 56 km\u00b2 (based on the 2x2 km grid calculation). Recent studies quantified the decline of Calopteryx exul in Algeria, which meet the Critically Endangered criteria (Khelifa &amp; Mellal, 2016).", "geographicrange": "<em>Calopteryx exul</em> is a north Maghrebian endemic, which has once been widespread in Morocco, northern Algeria and northern Tunisia.
