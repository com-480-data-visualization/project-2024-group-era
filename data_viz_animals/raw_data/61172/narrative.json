{"name": "61172", "result": [{"species_id": 61172, "taxonomicnotes": "This species was previously known under the cheironym <em>Pseudotropheus</em> sp. 'Elongatus Bar' (Ribbink <em>et al</em>. 1983, Konings 1990). This species previously appeared on the IUCN Red List in the genus <em>Pseudotropheus </em>Regan, 1922 but is now valid in the genus <em>Tropheops </em>Trewavas, 1984.", "rationale": "Endemic to the Nankumba Peninsula in Lake Malawi, the range is considered as a single location due to the potential impact of sedimentation, which could effect the entire population. It meets the area requirements under criterion B for Endangered. However, future declines in habitat quality or population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of increasing sedimentation on this species are unknown and it is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it is restricted to the Maleri islands and Chidunga Rocks.", "population": "<em>Tropheops modestus</em>&#160;is a common species within its distribution.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It occurs in sediment rich rocky habitats where it feeds on algae, which it picks from the rock surfaces. Territorial males are seen throughout the year and they defend their territories vigorously. In shallow waters solitary females may also defend a feeding territory. Spawning occurs inside the male's cave.", "threats": "Sedimentation of the rocky shore habitats is a potential threat.", "conservationmeasures": "It occurs mostly within the Lake Malawi National Park.", "usetrade": "This species is not targeted by the ornamental fish trade."}]}
