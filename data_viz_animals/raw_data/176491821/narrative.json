It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 19,273 km<sup>2</sup>. Modifications caused by land use change, urbanization, road  construction, and dams for energy and irrigation in agriculture are the  main threats to this species. There are four locations based on these threats, and a projected continuing decline in the area of occupancy (AOO). Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in tributaries to the Paran\u00e1 River in south-eastern Paraguay (Weber 1985).", "population": "The population documentation is null. Research and monitoring is needed to know population composition, structure, size and trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Probably a rheophilic species. However, there are no data about its habitat preferences and the information about its ecology is null.", "threats": "The distribution is located on two main roads in Paraguay and also in a region of importance for the agriculture and cattle sectors. Modifications caused by land use change, urbanization, road construction, and dams for energy and irrigation in agriculture are the main threats to this species. The severity of those threats to the species are unknown.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no research, monitoring and planning known to be conducted for this species. Research is necessary into its taxonomy, population, ecology, conservation and threats.", "usetrade": "It is used in the aquarium trade, as are most suckermouth armored catfishes."}]}
