Nimba region in Liberia and adjacent Guinea and the area in and around Sapo National Park in southern Liberai. It seems to be endemic to that area and should be monitored in the future. Even though the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence qualify for a higher threat category, we list the species as NT based on the experience that Cruisers in general are difficult to survey and underrepresented in collections. At the moment it is listed as Near Threatened, but might qualify for a higher threat category, if the habitat is disturbed B1a(i,ii) + B2a(i,ii). The growing population in Africa poses a growing threat in terms of habitat destruction (deforestation, logging) and habitat deterioration (water pollution).", "geographicrange": "The species is known from Mount Nimba (Legrand 1993, 2003) and the area of and around Sapo National Park. Cruisers are generally difficult to record, and thus a wider distribution in the area is assumed.", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Found in and around rainforest streams.", "threats": "Specific threats to the species are unknown, but deforestation as a result of agriculture and wood extraction, which is occurring in the area, is believed to be a threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "No information available but research into taxonomy, population numbers and range, biology and ecology, habitat status, threats, and trends/monitoring of this species would be valuable.", "usetrade": null}]}
