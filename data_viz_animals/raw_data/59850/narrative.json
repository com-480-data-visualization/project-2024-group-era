{"name": "59850", "result": [{"species_id": 59850, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species qualifies as Endangered due to the small number of locations (4), the restricted extent of occurrence (EOO) and the decline in the area, extent and quality of habitat. As the area is under-surveyed the species is assumed to be more widespread than the currently known range (records date back to 1985 or are even older).", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from east Democratic Republic of Congo (Ituri, Kivu). A record from Tanzania is a misinterpretation by Pinhey of Schmidt's side description: \u201cUrwald (Primeval forest) behind the bordering mountains of north-west Tanganyaka[sic]-Sees\u201d (Dijkstra 2007; Dijkstra, pers. comm.). The species might be more widespread in eastern Congo.", "population": "Population size is unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species habitat is forest streams.", "threats": "The main threats to the species are destruction of rainforests, clearing of forest areas along rivers and streams due to agriculture and wood extraction.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures known but information on taxonomy, population ecology, habitat status and population trends would be valuable. Habitat/site based conservation is also required.", "usetrade": null}]}
