{"name": "83128301", "result": [{"species_id": 83128301, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Nesobasis monticola</em>&#160;has regularly been recorded for about 40 years during field samplings on Viti Levu although with single specimens mainly females, although low number of individuals are usually recorded during field studies. It is believed that the population is stable, but localised at higher mountain areas near fast flowing sections of streams and close to waterfalls. Currently, it is assessed as Near Threatened because it has a small extent of occurrence (EOO is less than 10,000 km\u00b2) and it requires a highly specific type of habitat which can be easily compromised by human activities.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Fiji where it is reported for VIti Levu and Ovalau islands (Marinov and Waqa-Sakiti 2013).", "population": "Usually, this species has been recorded as single specimens. It has been regularly sampled during any field survey on Viti Levu for a period of 40 years. Therefore, the populations are believed to be persistent although not large and confined to particular parts of the mountain areas.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "The species inhabits fast flowing shallow streams with large bedrocks and exposed boulders. Waterfalls are part of the habitat too. Almost all observations are on females. They select areas close to the water edge and typically stay high on the tree sitting on leaves partly shaded by the other branches.", "threats": "There are no documented threats to this species.&#160;It is an inhabitant of fast flowing mountain streams that may be affected by human activities.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures on place for this species.&#160;It is an inhabitant of fast flowing mountain streams that may be affected by human activities&#160;and therefore monitoring of the population size and trends is suggested here.", "usetrade": null}]}
