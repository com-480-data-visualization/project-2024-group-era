Some locations are in protected areas (for example, Bach Ma National Park and Son Tra Nature Reserve). Some locations are close to the border with Laos, therefore the species should be looked for in Laos as well as Viet Nam. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to some extent at least due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 14,742\u201321,732 km\u00b2. Threats certainly exist to this species, at least outside protected areas, but it is difficult to gauge how serious the overall level of threat is. Taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it is hoped that a future reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible when more information becomes available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Leptogomphus inouei</em> is known from ten locations in Central Viet Nam (Karube <em>et al. </em>2020, Karube 2014, Kompier unpub. data).
