It has a known area of occupancy (AOO) of 12 km<sup>2 </sup>and the best estimate of the extent of occurrence (EOO) is 100-5,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The species is threatened by habitat destruction, human disturbances, and pollution in the lower Orinoco River basin. There are 1-3 locations based on the threat of pollution, which is also inferred to be causing a continuing decline in habitat quality. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Sternarchorhynchus mendesi&#160;</em>is only known from the R\u00edo San Juan and R\u00edo Guanipa basins draining northeastern Venezuela into the Golfo de Paria (de Santana and Vari 2010). It is currently known from only three localities separated by c. 50 km in rapids of small rivers draining into the mouth of the Orinoco River.<br/><br/>The area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) based on these known localities are 12 km<sup>2</sup> and 27 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The upper limit of the EOO based on the HydroBASIN distribution map is 12,275 km<sup>2</sup>.
