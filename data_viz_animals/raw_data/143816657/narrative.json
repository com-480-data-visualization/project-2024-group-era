The assessors are aware of records from 11 locations, however six of these date from 1949; there are only recent records from five locations. The species is present in two protected areas: Manupeu Tanah Daru and Laiwangi Wanggameti National Parks. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, is inferred to be declining to some degree at least due to loss of habitat outside protected areas in Sumba. Its maximum extent of occurrence (EOO) is smaller than 20,000 km\u00b2. Given that the species is confirmed to still occur at only five locations, but possibly could occur at more, it is assessed as Vulnerable undr criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). It seems likely that this species is still widespread across Sumba, and it is therefore to be hoped that reassessment to Near Threatened or even Least Concern will be possible in the not-too-distant future when more information is available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Hemicordulia chrysochlora</em> is endemic to Sumba in the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia, where it is known from records scattered across the island (Irawan and Rahadi 2018, Lieftinck 1953).
