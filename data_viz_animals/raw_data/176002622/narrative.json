It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 6,384 km<sup>2</sup>. There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat due to illegal mining in the Atababo river basin where is restricted. There are four locations based on this threat.<br/></p>", "geographicrange": "<p>This species occurs in the Orinoco Basin in Colombia and Venezuela (Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2004a, DoNascimiento <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is restricted to the Atabapo River (Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2004b), where it appears to be endemic.</p>", "population": "<p>Apparently it is a very rare species in its natural environment, the Atabapo River (Lasso and Machado-Allison 2000). </p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>It is only known to live in a black water river (Atabapo river) (Lasso and Machado-Allison 2000), associated with vegetation and submerged logs (C. Lasso pers. obs.).</p>", "threats": "<p>There is mining in most of its distribution area within the Orinoco Mining Arc (AMO) (of bauxite, copper, coltan, diamonds, iron and gold), which results in deforestation, riverbed alteration, sedimentation, contamination by heavy metals, and discharge of gasoline, oil and human sewage (CERLAS 2019, Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2006ab, SOS-Orinoco 2019, Oliveira-Miranda 2020).

Occasionally it is part of subsistence fisheries of indigenous communities of the Atabapo River (C. Lasso pers. obs.).&#160;The species is included in Resolution number 1924 of the National Authority of Fisheries and Aquaculture of Colombia-AUNAP (list of ornamental fish of Colombia).
