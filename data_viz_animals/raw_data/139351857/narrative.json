{"name": "139351857", "result": [{"species_id": 139351857, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Metaphya micans</em> is only known from peat swamp forest in Borneo. Only four locations (five sites) have ever been recorded for this extremely locally occurring peat swamp forest species and it can only be considered as currently known from three of these. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the currently available data but it is estimated to be less than 500 km\u00b2, the overall population is certainly severely fragmented, and the AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat is declining. Threats exist at all locations, including the protected ones. The species is assessed as Endangered under criteria B2ab(ii,iii).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Metaphya micans</em> is endemic to Borneo where it is known from a few scattered locations in peat swamp forest in Brunei (Thompson and van Tol 1993, Dow unpublished), southwest Sarawak (Laidlaw 1913, Dow unpublished) and Central Kalimantan (Husson <em>et al.</em> 2018). The type locality, on the Matang Road near Kuching (Laidlaw 1913) has probably long since been built over, so that only three locations can be considered as currently known; two sites have been recorded for the species in the Sungai Ingei area in Brunei, but they are close enough together that they should be taken as one threat-defined location (with forest fire in a dry season as the main threat). However all of these locations are in protected areas. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the currently available data but the total extent of suitable habitat (peat swamp forest) remaining in Borneo is less than 30,000 km\u00b2 (based on figures in Miettinen <em>et al. </em>2016) and the species appears to occur so locally that, based on current knowledge, it is not likely to occupy much more than 1% of this habitat, therefore the currently known AOO is less than 500 km\u00b2. The AOO will also be declining due to loss and degradation of peat swamp forest throughout the species\u2019 range.</p>", "population": "<p>This is an extremely locally occurring species that appears to occur at low densities where it does occur. An accurate estimate of its population is not remotely possible with the currently available information, but the population will be declining due to loss and degradation of peat swamp forest throughout the species\u2019 range. The overall population is undoubtedly already severely fragmented due to loss of peat swamp forest.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species occurs very locally in peat swamp forest and associated peripheral formations. Females have been observed apparently ovipositing into small pools and channels and the assessor collected a freshly emerged male deep inside peat swamp forest in Ulu Sebuyau National Park in Sarawak, remote from free water. The species may be particularly sensitive to disturbance and only occur in the most intact parts of peat swamp forest remaining.</p>", "threats": "<p>The primary threat to this species is from habitat loss. As of 2011 it was estimated (Posa <em>et al</em>. 2011) that from the original peat swamp forests in the areas where <em>Metaphya micans</em> is known to occur, only 46.6% remained in Kalimantan, 25.3% in peninsular Malaysia and 36.2% in Sarawak and Sabah, with only Brunei suffering a smaller reduction with 83.9% remaining. Most of this habitat loss is through conversion of forest to agriculture, principally oil palm although, for instance, very large areas were lost in Central Kalimantan when peat swamp forest was cleared for the so-called Mega Rice Project, which failed. Clearance of peat swamp forest for oil palm plantation is ongoing throughout most of the range of <em>Metaphya micans</em>. Forest fires during dry seasons are another serious threat to the habitats of this species and peat swamp forest fires are notoriously difficult to put out. Many fires, especially in Indonesia, appear to be deliberately set to clear forest, but it has proved difficult to bring prosecutions against those responsible.<br/><br/>Logging is still a threat to the habitats of <em>Metaphya micans</em>. Although large-scale legal logging operations have probably largely ceased in peat swamp forest throughout most of the range of the species, some smaller scale operations still occur and illegal logging is a serious threat, especially since no minimum cutting diameters are enforced so that the forest is likely to be opened up to the point where the species cannot survive. Another potential threat to <em>Metaphya micans</em> is from excessive drainage; at sites adjacent to oil palm plantations, other agricultural areas, human habitation etc., drainage ditches intended to drain the plantation etc. also lower the water table of the peat swamp forest, therefore affecting the presumed larval habitat and increasing vulnerability to fire. Another form of drainage occurs within peat swamp forest at sites in Kalimantan that have been logged in the past, in these cases a grid of channels have been cut across the peat dome, presumably to allow timber to be taken out on small boats. </p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More data on the distribution of this species are urgently needed, and a better understanding of its exact habitat requirements. Any new sites that are discovered should be given protected status if they do not already have it (but this is unlikely to happen), and increased vigilance is needed at protected areas, both against forest fires and illegal logging activities. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
