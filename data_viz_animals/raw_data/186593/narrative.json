It has disappeared from much of its former range and is considered to be possibly extinct in Uruguay. Given ongoing threats from mostly overexploitation, as well as pollution, dams, agriculture, flooding, and other anthropogenic activities, as well as past reduction rates in the early 2000's of over 75% in the upper Paran\u00e1 basin, a reduction rate approaching 30% over the past three generation length (18 years) is suspected for the overall population. As such, the species is assessed as Near Threatened A2bcde. Further research is required to quantify current and future reduction rates too.", "geographicrange": "<p>This species is present in the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1 River basin, occurring in the La Plata drainage (Agostinho <em>et al.</em> 2003, J\u00e9gu 2003), spanning&#160;Argentina (Lopez <em>et al.&#160;</em>1987), Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and previously Uruguay (Lovshin 1995); the Uruguay population is now believed possibly extinct (Mello <em>et al.</em> 2011).

It has also disappeared from the lower Paran\u00e1 and the La Plata River since the 1980s (Quiros 1993). The remaining subpopulations are the target of several threats and are described as being only sporadically caught in Tiete, Grande, Paranaiba and Paranapanema rivers.<br/><br/><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">Specifically, in the upper Paraguay river basin,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;<em>Piaractus mesopotamicus<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;</em>is frequent and abundant, being the third species in catching, with records of about 38 tons annually in Mato Grosso do Sul. There was an indication of the species overfishing in the 1990, but currently, the catches are stable in the region. In the upper Paraguay, the Fishing Institute annually registered the professional fishing decline of Pacu, in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. In the technical reports, concerning the fish landing in the years 2001 to 2005 in the rivers Paranapanema, Paran\u00e1 and Grande, this species presented a decline of more than 75% over that period, in the three cited water bodies<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;(<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">Oyakawa<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Many hybrids and cultivated Tambaqui specimens\u2019 introductions, escapes, and releases have the potential to cause occasional hybridizations, with damages to the genetic background of wild populations and, consequently, to the fishing income.&#160;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><br/><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><br/><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">The species is also subjected to anthropogenic impacts resulting from hydroelectric projects and also from natural variations in Pantanal inter-annual drought and flood periods. Although the Paran\u00e1 river basin area, where the species occur, is about twice the Paraguay river, it is considered that the species' population in Brazil is significantly larger in the Paraguay river basin than in the upper Paran\u00e1 river basin due to the higher productivity of the Paraguay river (Pantanal floodplain). The Brazilian subpopulations of these two river basins have no interconnectivity and no inputs are expected to the upper Paran\u00e1 subpopulation, totally compromised by the fragmentation caused by successive damming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&#160;&#160;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><span

class=\"Apple-converted-space\">It is, however, difficult to determine what past decline rates would have been like after 2005, given the significant decline over just 4 years, and given the long generation length of this species. As such, in the absence of current population trend information, a slower rate of decline (approaching 30%) is suspected for the past 18-year (three generation) period nevertheless. Further research is therefore vital to determine if reduction&#160; rates have continued to be as significant. The population is also inferred to be declining at present given ongoing threats, and a continuing decline in mature individuals is inferred.&#160;<br/></span></span></span></span></span><span

"populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species is a freshwater species of rivers and seasonal lakes, averaging 50 cm length (Britski <em>et al</em>. 2007) although 70 cm or more has also be recorded (Carolsfeld <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003). The species is highly migratory (Hogan 2011); its colours also change with migration from almost black in flooded areas to bright yellow when it enters the headwaters for reproduction. It feeds on fruit seeds and leaves and less frequently on crabs, molluscs and insects (Silva 1985). Gonad maturation occurs in the Upper Pantanal between July and October prior to spawning between October and December (Lima <em>et al</em>. 1984a, 1984b).</p>", "threats": "This species is believed to be overexploited in the Upper Paran\u00e1 and Upper Paraguay and is threatened below their confluence (Carolsfeld <em>et al.</em> 2003, Hogan 2011); from 1994-1998, this was the most captured species in the Mato Grosso State in the Paran\u00e1 area. Despite actions to prevent overfishing, it is believed that illegal fishing is probably equal in tonnage capture to legal fishing in the Pantanal (mainly the Taquari River Basin).<br/><br/>The possibility of long term \u201clow flooding\u201d could also have dire consequences on the fish in the Upper Paran\u00e1.<br/><br/>Other issues highlighted by IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources) include sedimentation, dams and dyking, water contamination, and large-scale works such as gold mining (including river dredging and the liquid gas pipeline that crosses the Pantanal) (Dolabella 2000). The extraction of <em>Pfaffia </em>in the Paran\u00e1 Basin is considered to directly effect <em>Piaractus mesopotamicus </em>by burning the riparian vegetation which is an important food source for this species (Agostinho <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Some efforts to abate the problems created by dams, including fish ladders, appear to have varied success for this species. A study of the Itaipu Dam found that this species did not enter the fish ladder at all despite being found downstream, the reason for this was suggested to be the height of the fishes' spine (Borghetti <em>et al</em>. 1994). Where the species is able to ascend fish ladders, descent does not seem to be equally facilitated.<br/><br/>In the sections of the Paran\u00e1 without dams there is ship traffic which is linked to the erosion of river banks. Other general threats in the area include habitat degradation and conversion caused by agriculture, pollution from chemical agents, sand extraction, cattle raising and irrigated rice culture.", "conservationmeasures": "This species was highlighted as a species that would benefit from an Appendix II CMS listing to aid in the international cooperation required to conserve the species. Starting in 1994, the minimum capture size was increased from 40 to 45 cm in Colombia. In the lower Paran\u00e1, fishing for this species is prohibited (Carolsfeld <em>et al.</em> 2003). In the lower Paran\u00e1, drift gill nets were banned in 1986 and cast nets in 1994. Smaller mesh nets are allowed only for the capture of bait by commercial fishermen. The Mato Grosso government is trying to create regulatory measures to limit environmental impact of mining waste. In addition, Agostinho <em>et al.</em> (2003) recommend the prohibition of <em>Pfaffia </em>harvesting along the Paran\u00e1 river.<br/><br/>In the past this species has been stocked, although not intensively, there is no knowledge as to the effectiveness of these efforts (Agostinho <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>This species is found in three protected areas: the Ivinhemia State Park, Ilha Grande National Park and the Environmental Protection Area of the Island and Varzea of the Paran\u00e1.", "usetrade": "This species occurs in commercial aquaculture, food, and sport fishing (Catella and Peixoto 2003), and in most Brazilian states is an important food fish. Since the early nineties, sport fishing has become a main earning source in the region and in the middle Paran\u00e1; in 1992, 6,500 sport fishing licenses were issued in the Corrientes province; by 1997, an estimated 5,000 fishermen were on the river every weekend (CIH 1997), the international fishing reputation of this area results in multiple international fishing derbies."}]}
