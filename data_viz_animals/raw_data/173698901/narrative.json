However, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of natural habitats on Sangihe Island.

Important habitat requirements were apparently large broken logs standing in the water. Above a small waterfall \u2026 the stream was characterized by small cascades, pools and shallow, but still flowing sections with a bed of gravel. Below the waterfall, the character changed increasingly to a sandy lowland stream. <em>Rhinocypha togeanensis</em> was absent in lower (sandy) reaches of the still fast flowing Sungai Tanimpo within disturbed primary forest, secondary forests and plantations. Current Google EarthTM images show that the site has now been largely deforested.\u201d (van Tol and G\u00fcnther 2018: 371), nothing else is known. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>Alteration of natural habitats for agriculture appears to be the main threat to this species at present.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There is an urgent need for protection of habitat where this species occurs and for more information on the distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance of this species. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
