It possibly also occurs in the southwestern arm. It meets the area requirements under criterion B1 for Endangered and it is known from two locations. However, future declines in habitat quality or population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of subsistence fishing on this species are unknown and it is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it has been recorded from Boadzulu Island and Manzinzi Bay in the southeastern arm of the lake. It is possibly also present in the southwestern arm of the lake.", "population": "No information is available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It occurs over sandy habitat at depths of more than 20 m. Small groups forage from the substrate. These small groups usually contain one male exhibiting breeding colouration.", "threats": "Bycatch in subsistence fishing by chirimila fishermen is a threat to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "No information is available on conservation actions for this species. Site protection and population monitoring is recommended.", "usetrade": "This species is not targeted by the ornamental fish trade but, like all Malawi cichlids, this&#160;is a food fish. It is rarely caught as bycatch by subsistence fishermen using chirimila nets but not specifically targeted."}]}
