{"name": "233928575", "result": [{"species_id": 233928575, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species is endemic in Greece, where it is known only from one single locality in the Sperchios River, the type locality. The water regime of the river is heavily exploited (water abstraction) for various human activities. In addition, the river's water regime is affected directly and indirectly by the climate change effects, extreme temperatures and floods. Therefore, the species is prone to the effects of human activities and stochastic events within a very short time period (e.g. within one or two generations; this is a short-lived species) in an uncertain future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period. Consequently, the species is assessed as Vulnerable (VU D2).", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to Greece and was recently described (Reisch\u00fctz and Reisch\u00fctz 2020). It is known only from the type locality (Kostalexi, near Lamia), where it was found in river deposits, therefore the species possibly could have originated from higher in the river catchment; this needs to be confirmed.", "population": "No population data are available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species was found in river deposits in the Sperchios River, in running waters.", "threats": "The species is known only from a single locality in the Sperchios River.
