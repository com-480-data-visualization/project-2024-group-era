Populations have in fact steeply declined (by at least 50% over 10 years) throughout its range (Quir\u00f3s 1990, Agostinho <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mello <em>et al</em>. 2011, Lima 2017). Though pollution and removal of the riparian forest were certainly important factors that contributed to the decline of the species, the disappearance of this previous widespread species throughout most of its range should be primarily imputed to the drastic alterations in flow regime caused by damming (Lima 2017).&#160;<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<em>Brycon orbignyanus</em> originally occurred in middle to large sized rivers, and at floodplain lakes and channels associated with large rivers. The species preferred forested rivers and was considered to be mainly frugivorous. However in 46 specimens from the Paran\u00e1 river, stomach contents included insects and other invertebrates, vegetal matter, and fishes (Lima 2017).<br/><br/>Size at first maturation is reported to be 30 cm TL, being reached at 2\u20133 years of age. The species is well-known as a migratory species. At the lower rio Paran\u00e1 and rio Uruguai at Argentina and Uruguay, it migrated downstream during October, moving upstream during March. Breeding in the southern part of the range of the species took place between December and January. On other hand, at the upper rio Paran\u00e1 basin the reproductive migration is undertaken upstream (Ihering 1929, Magalh\u00e3es 1931, Godoy 1975, Lima 2017). The upstream migration in rio Mogi-Gua\u00e7\u00fa started by the end of September, and spawning took place between November and January (Godoy 1975, Lima 2017). At the rio Piracicaba, Magalh\u00e3es (1931,&#160;<em>via&#160;</em> Lima 2017) reported reproductive schools moving upstream the river between December and January, and, on one occasion, hundreds of specimens were observed entering a flooded area, the males then apparently chasing the females. Ihering (1929) estimated that females ranging between 570 and 690 mm in total length possessed a total fecundity of 500,000 to 1,000,000 oocytes. After spawning, the species moves downstream, sometimes considerably far from the spawning site. Godoy (1975,&#160;<em>via</em>&#160;Lima 2017) reported that two specimens captured and tagged at Cachoeira de Emas (rio Mogi Gua\u00e7\u00fa) were recaptured two to four months later 601\u2013637 km downstream, into the rio Grande. Thorm\u00e4hlen de Gil (1949,&#160;<em>via</em> Lima 2017) studied annuli rings in scales and calculated that specimens between 90\u2013116 mm SL are less than two years old, specimens between 123\u2013215 mm SL are 2\u20133 years old and specimens between 229\u2013245 mm SL are 4\u20135 years old (Lima 2017).", "threats": "<span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\">Pollution and the removal of riparian forests were important factors  that contributed to the decline of the species, but its disappearance in  most of its distribution area was primarily due to the drastic change in  the flow regime due to dams.
