Threats exist at all known locations and the overall population is believed to be severely fragmented. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it may not be large and with the available data is very unlikely to be greater than 2,000 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criterion B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly. When more data are available it is to be hoped that re-assessment to a lower threat category will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Leptogomphus semperi</em> is known from scattered records from Basilan, Dinagat, Leyte, Mindanao and Samar in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.
