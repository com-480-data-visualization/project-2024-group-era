The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 664 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 544 km<sup>2</sup>. However, it is expected that this species also occurs in similar habitats along upper portions of Kumbu River. Further survey work is needed to survey for this species in more localities in order to better understand its real range. Although the distribution of the species is inside the Brownsberg Nature Park, it borders the left margin of Brokopondo Dam lake area, and there are also proposed and ongoing mining activities, which represent potential severe impacts to the species due to the changes in the habitat. There is one threat-based location. Thus, it is recommended to monitor the species and the area to better understand the range and population status. <em>Guyanancistrus brownsbergensis</em> is assessed as Endangered (EN).

The Upper Kumbu Creek at Kumbu Falls is a small mountain stream (2.5 to 3.7 m wide, and 28 to 50 cm water depth) with cool water (23.1 to 23.2\u00b0C), high dissolved oxygen content (93-96% saturation; 7.08\u00b17.72 mg/L), a pH of 7.0\u00b17.5, conductivity 30.8\u00b131.6 \u03bcS/cm, and a current strength of 0.29\u00b10.56 m/s. The bottom substrate consists of sand, gravel, pebbles, boulders and bedrock. The water is mostly clear. Fisch-Muller <em>et al. </em>(2018) observed no aquatic vegetation in the stream, but overhanging terrestrial vegetation, submersed root masses, woody debris, leaf litter and rock crevices offered ample hiding places for <em>G</em>. <em>brownsbergensis</em>.
