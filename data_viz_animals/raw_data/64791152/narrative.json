This species is endemic to upper Guaviare and Meta drainages in Colombia. The species has been found in rivers Guayabero, Guatiqu\u00eda, Manacac\u00edas, Guavio, Upamena, Vichada and Cusiana (Maldonado-Ocampo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2008, Urbano-Bonilla <em>et al.</em> 2009).

The current population trend probably is decreasing according to its exploitation in the ornamental fishery. Also, in the future a population decline is likely due to the effects of fisheries and a loss of habitat quality given the regional expansion of the human frontier.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<em>Corydoras axelrodi </em>inhabits creeks, streams and rivers, including springs. It can be found in clearwater, streams with flow over heterogeneous substrates. It is a sociable fish, forming schools of varying size and&#160;capable of air breathing. The species is a benthic omnivore. It has parental care of eggs and young, and&#160;can be 42 mm in standard length (Reis 2003).", "threats": "Ornamental fishing pressure has an important effect on the natural populations of <em>Corydoras </em>species. Another threat is the destruction of its habitat by sedimentation and pollution associated with urban centers, deforestation, agriculture and industrial developments, and oil exploitation (Etter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Romero-Ru\u00edz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Brice\u00f1o 2015).", "conservationmeasures": "It is included in ornamental fishing regulations (Ortega-Lara&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015) and the range includes conservation sites and protected areas.

The actual volume of harvest is unknown. It is reported in landing from ports in the rivers In\u00edrida and Villavicencio, and in this last port about 16,000 individuals of this species were reported between January and December 2013 (Ortega-Lara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).</p>"}]}
