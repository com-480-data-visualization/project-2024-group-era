{"name": "176426674", "result": [{"species_id": 176426674, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species occurs in the Guyraugua River, tributary to the Monday River, Paran\u00e1 River basin in Paraguay. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,916 km<sup>2</sup>. Threats are changes, transformation, and modifications of its habitats  due to urbanization, road construction, and irrigation in agriculture. There is a single location and an inferred continuing decline in habitat based on these threats. There is a continuing decline in the area of occupancy (AOO) because fish sampling in the Guyraugua River in 2019 did not succeed in collecting specimens despite collections being made two years earlier. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in the Guyraugua River, tributary to the Monday River, Paran\u00e1 River basin in Paraguay (Mahnert and Gery 1987, Fricke <em>et al. </em>2020).", "population": "This is a rare species and the population documentation is null.
