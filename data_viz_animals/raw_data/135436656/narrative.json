An accurate estimate of the Area of Occupancy (AOO) of the species is not possible with the available data, but if it is confined to Central Kalimantan is likely to be less than 15,000km<sup>2</sup>, possibly considerably less, below the 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> threshold for Vulnerable status, and the AOO will be declining. With at most nine locations currently known, inferred declines in overall population, AOO and quality and extent of suitable habitat, and threats at all locations the species is close to qualifying for Vulnerable status under criterion D2 and B2ab(ii,iii) (would qualify if its AOO was known to be less than 2,000km<sup>2</sup>) and is assessed as Near Threatened accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p></p><p><em>Elattoneura erythromma</em> is endemic to Borneo where it is known from nine locations in Central Kalimantan (Lieftinck 1953, Dow &amp; Silvius 2014). The species appears to be confined to peat swamp forest and associated peripheral forest formations and its area of occupancy (AOO) is therefore constrained by the remaining area of such habitat in the province, and based on the figures in Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2016 (considering pristine and degraded peat swamp forest) is therefore less than about 15,000km<sup>2</sup>, probably considerably less than this, and it might be below the 2,000km<sup>2</sup> threshold for Vulnerable status. The species is recorded from Sebangau National Park (where forest fires have already degraded parts of the species\u2019 habitat). Two of the other locations enjoy some measure of protection because of their Orangutan populations, but to the assessors knowledge this protection is not formal and will effectively vanish if and when scientists and others working on the Orangutans are no longer present in the areas. The AOO and quality and extent of suitable habitat of this species are certainly declining.</p><br/><p></p>", "population": "<p>This species can be locally common in peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, beyond this little can be said with the available data except that at least some decline to the overall population must have occurred and be ongoing due to loss of lowland forest within its range.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species appears to be confined to peat swamp forest and associated peripheral forest formations.
