There are lower intensity impacts from gathering of non-y[sic]imber forest products, tourism, hunting, fishing and grazing. Unfortunately, government programmes promoting plantation agriculture and forestry are providing encouragement to communities to encroach into the protected area and its buffer zone. Further, the lack of security of tenure over the land by local communities has created an open access situation; it is a disincentive to investing in more sustainable agricultural practices and leaves local communities powerless when trying to keep people from expanding agriculture into the forest areas. On the southern slope of Mt Kitanglad, especially in the Lantapan and Basak areas, vegetable farming techniques (the \u201cgardening technology\u201d) have been brought in by migrant Igorots from Luzon\u2019s Mountain Province. Large tracts of montane forest have been cleared for this by burning and then planted to cultivars that do not thrive in the lowlands, including cabbage, potato, radish and carrots. Fires that spread into the forests from adjacent grasslands are also a problem. Overhunting and commercial collecting of wildlife are widespread. Vast agricultural plantations have been established, such as a Dole pineapple plantation. These have displaced local farmers, who have destroyed secondary forests for farming, and fires started to burn areas of forest have gone out of control.\u201d For the Kalatungan Mountains, again based on data compiled in 2001 BirdLife International (2019b) state that \u201cPressures on the habitats and wildlife in the Kalatungan Mountains include kaingin, forest fires, and the exploitation of forest products (e.g. rattan) and unregulated wildlife hunting. The most destructive of these is the conversion of forest into agricultural land and the introduction of cash crops. In addition to the ethnic Manobo and Talaandig tribes, Boholanos and Cebuanos from the Visayas have settled into the area by renting or buying land.\u201d Recent satellite images show little forest below 1200-1500m a.s.l. in many parts of both ranges, suggesting that the encroachment into these protected areas has continued unchecked.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance and, urgently, for better protection for the two protected areas where it occurs. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
