{"name": "157782070", "result": [{"species_id": 157782070, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from two restricted locations in the distinctive and restricted habitat of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 3,650 m to 3,688 m bsl. One location lies within a deep-sea mining licence area within the Papua New Guinea EEZ. As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted AOO, and has been found at a limited number of locations, it would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction at these deep-sea mining sites. However, the other known location lies within an MPA within the USA EEZ, and this population is protected from the impacts of commercial exploitation and deep-sea mining. Therefore, owing to the significant protection provided by this MPA and the resulting variability in extinction risk for the different populations, we have opted to assess the species as Near Threatened. The species is close to qualifying for a threatened category based on the potential threat of mining activity in a subset of locations where the species occurs. As such, the NT assessment is dependent on the maintenance of the current marine protection within the USA EEZ vent field. A reassessment would therefore be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of the MPA, whereby the species would become EN B2ab(iii), based on the projected continuing decline in habitat associated with the location in the mining licence area.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to two locations at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. One location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the USA, the other location lying within the Papua New Guinea EEZ. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 3,650 m bsl to 3,688 m bsl. It has been observed from two vent fields: at the Alice Springs vent field (Location 1) within the USA EEZ and the PACMANUS vent field (Location 2) within the Papua New Guinea EEZ (Okuntani 1990, War\u00e9n and Bouchet 2001, Wang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Okutani 1990, War\u00e9n and Bouchet 2001, Wang <em>et al. </em>2018).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 3,650 m to 3,688 m bsl.", "threats": "The PACMANUS (1) vent field lies within the Papua New Guinea Exclusive Economic Zone and is not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The Papua New Guinea Government has granted exploratory and subsequent exploitative mining licences to Nautilus Mineral Cooperation within the Manus Basin (Gena 2013). Polymetallic sulphide resource exploration can include some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation phases, hence there may already be disturbance of the subpopulation at this location. As well as direct impacts, evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. We therefore consider the current exploratory mining and the likelihood of future exploitative mining licences within the Papua New Guinea EEZ to be a significant threat to the species. The Alice Springs (2) vent field lies within the USA Exclusive Economic Zone and is found within the Mariana Trench National Monument (MTNM) which was established in 2009. Vents within the MTNM are Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and mining is prohibited here (Beaulieu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Richmond&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issues marine mining permits, however they have no authority to issue permits in the EEZ of the US Territories. There is currently no regulatory structure that would allow any deep sea mining within the USA EEZ of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or Guam. The Minerals Management Policy also states that extracting or developing leasable Federal minerals on National Wildlife Refuge System land (i.e. the MTNM) is prohibited (US Fish &amp; Wildlife, 2016). We have therefore concluded that there is no threat to <em>Provanna nassariaeformis</em><em>&#160;</em>at this location at this time.", "conservationmeasures": "The Alice Springs vent field, which lies within the USA EEZ, is a Marine Protected Area and is protected from commercial and scientific exploitation (Beaulieu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Richmond&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). There are no conservation actions currently in place at any vent fields within the Papua New Guinea EEZ. We recommend that specific national/international legislation is required for the protection of deep-sea habitats and resources. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites within the region.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
