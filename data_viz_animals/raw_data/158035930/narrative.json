The assessor is aware of records from seven sites in upland areas of central and southeastern Hainan, including in Wuzhishan and Yinggeling national nature reserves. Its area of occupancy (AOO) is unknown, but it is unlikely to be declining significantly, based on the known distributional information; however, surveys in unprotected areas of Hainan have been limited. Its current known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 688\u20132,205 km\u00b2, which is small enough to meet the criterion B1 threshold for Endangered; however, it is known from more than five locations (seven locations are currently known), so it cannot be placed in the EN category. If the AOO or extent or quality of suitable habitat were known to be declining, it would qualify for Vulnerable under criterion B1. However, since it is not certain that either the AOO or the quality or extent of suitable habitat is declining, this species is best assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B1ab(iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Agriomorpha xinglongensis </em>is endemic to Hainan Island, China.
