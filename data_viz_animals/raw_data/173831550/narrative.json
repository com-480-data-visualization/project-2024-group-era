Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 492 km<sup>2</sup> and area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 24 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a limited number of georeferenced collection records. Total population size and population trend are unknown. The primary threat to this species is land-use change associated with deforestation, farming, ranching, and mining (Sousa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, the direct impact and scope of existing threats have not been quantified and therefore it is not possible to accurately estimate the number of threat-based locations where this species occurs. Therefore, <em>F. gianetii</em> is assessed as Near Threatened under criterion B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). Additional ichthyological surveys will be necessary to clarify range extent, population size, and population trend, and may result in qualification for a higher threatened category.", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Farlowella gianetii </em>is restricted to the upper Xingu River basin, having been reported from the Couto de Magalh\u00e3es and Culuene Rivers, and from smaller tributaries in Mato Grosso State, Brazil (Ballen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). </p>  <p>Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 492 km<sup>2</sup>, calculated by generating a minimum convex polygon around georeferenced collection records (Ballen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 24 km<sup>2</sup>, calculated by overlaying a 2x2 km grid on known collection localities. Because there are a limited number of targeted surveys in adjacent streams, and due to uncertainties regarding the scope and direct impact of existing threats, the number of threat-based locations where this species occurs cannot be determined with accuracy. More comprehensive survey efforts will probably yield a number of additional collection localities and are necessary to clarify the range extent of this species.</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>This species is known from rivers and tributary streams in the upper Xingu River basin (Ballen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). </p>", "threats": "<p>The primary threat to this species is land-use change associated with deforestation, farming, ranching, and mining (Trancoso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Panday&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Sousa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Development incentives initiated by state government in the 1970s have resulted in uncontrolled land use, road construction, and the establishment of a number of hydroelectric projects (Camargo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Widespread deforestation associated with past cattle ranching and the expansion of the agricultural frontier (primarily soy production) have altered evapotranspiration and streamflow in the upper Xingu River basin (Dias&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Ilha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).
