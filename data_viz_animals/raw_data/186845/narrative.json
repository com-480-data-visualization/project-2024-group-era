The species is rheophilic, being found in deep places that follow rapids in medium to large rivers. It has a nocturnal habit and apparently performs moderate migratory movements for reproduction (Agostinho <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zaniboni and Schulz&#160;2003). Studies of food and reproductive biology were carried out in the upper Uruguay River by Meurer and Zaniboni-Filho (2000), revealing that it is an essentially piscivorous species, presenting more intense feeding activity during the autumn. Data on the species in the tributaries of the upper Paran\u00e1 River reveal that reproduction occurs essentially from October to December, and may extend until February. The species presents concentrated spawning during the spring and early summer, with the release of oocytes with an average diameter of 0.143 mm and an average relative fecundity of 16,090 oocytes / kg of fish (Meurer and Zaniboni-Filho 2000). This species has larger oocytes than that observed for other pyramids and much lower fertility, characteristic of species with stricter reproductive migration strategies. Maturity is reached at 42 cm in total length for males and 48 cm for females (Agostinho <em>et al. </em>2003). Fertility is 24,957.59 \u00b1 10,809.62 oocytes and a diameter of 2.85 \u00b1 0.03 mm (Shibatta<em> et al.</em> 2011).</span>", "threats": "It is sensitive to habitat destruction by dams because it is a species that occurs in rapids. As it apparently has a scattered distribution, restricted to this type of habitat, the preservation of lotic stretches is fundamental to ensure its conservation.
