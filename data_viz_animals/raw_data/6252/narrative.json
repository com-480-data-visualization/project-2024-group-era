{"name": "6252", "result": [{"species_id": 6252, "taxonomicnotes": "<em>Danio pathirana </em>was described from southern Sri Lanka by Kottelat and Pethiyagoda in 1990 and later was placed in the genus <em>Devario</em> by Feng in 2001 (Batuwita <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;This species is a barred <em>Devario</em>, whose distinctive color pattern immediately distinguishes it from the striped Sri Lankan <em>Devario</em> fishes.", "rationale": "<em>Devario pathirana</em> is a range-restricted, endemic species, known only from the upper catchment of the Nilwala River Basin of Sri Lanka. Its estimated Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is around 204 km<sup>2</sup>, and its Area of Occupancy (AOO) is 52 km<sup>2</sup>. A continuing decline in the extent and quality of the species natural habitat has been observed as a result of deforestation for tea, rubber,  and coconut plantations, rice paddies, and human settlements. This species is also threatened by water pollution from agricultural  effluents, gem mining activities, and exploitation for the aquarium trade. These threats are likely to continue in the future as the area is undergoing agricultural expansion and there is no current protection for the majority of its habitat. The species is therefore assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Devario pathirana</em> is an endemic freshwater fish species restricted to the Nilwala River Basin in the southern lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka, where it has been recorded from Opatha and Weerapana near Akuressa, and at the Dediyagala Forest Reserve (Batuwita <em>et al</em>. 2017).", "population": "<em>D. pathirana</em> is reported to be numerous within its limited range (Pethiyagoda 1994). A decline in its population could be inferred on the basis of the threats that it faces.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>The species is found to occur among still pools and swift flowing streams with pebble or boulder substrates. They are seldom found to occur over sandy substrates. It has not been found in silted rivulets which flow into main streams. The species is known, however, to show a preference for still pools. Captive breeding carried out by the National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka has shown that flowing water provides the best conditions for successful breeding (Pethiyagoda 1991, Gunasekera 2011, De Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>", "threats": "<em>D. pathirana</em> is threatened by deforestation and agricultural effluents (Pethiyagoda 1994). The natural habitat of this species is associated with rain forests and dark, shaded areas vital for the survival of the species. During the past two centuries, nearly all the natural forests in this eco-region have been cleared for tea, rubber, and coconut plantations, rice paddies, and human settlements (WWF 2001). This species is also threatened by gem mining practices and exploitation for the aquarium trade.", "conservationmeasures": "<p>This species is restricted from exports in accordance to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act No. 02 of 1996 and it is listed as a protected species under the&#160;Fauna &amp; Flora Protection Ordinance No. 2 of 1937 (last amendment by Act No. 22 of 2009).</p>", "usetrade": "Fernando <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2013) indicated that <em>D. pathirana </em>brought in the least revenue among exported endemic fish between the period of 2012/2013. However, it remains a popular ornamental fish species and is extensively exported."}]}
