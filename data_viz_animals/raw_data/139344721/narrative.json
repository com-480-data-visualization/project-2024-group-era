The two known locations are approximately 220 km apart. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to some extent due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its maximum current extent of occurrence (EOO) is 8,842 km\u00b2. Although the species is common at the two known locations, definite threats exist at one of them; if the species were to become extinct at that site, it would rapidly become Critically Endangered. The species is assessed as Vulnerable criteria B and D (VU B1ab(ii,iii); D2). It is hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Chlorogomphus piaoacensis</em> is known from the Mount Pia Oac area in northern Viet Nam and a location in Yunnan, China (Karube 2013, Zhang 2019, unpublished).
