An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but despite the relatively wide range the AOO is not likely to be large, quite likely around or less than 2,000km<sup>2</sup> and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to continuing loss and degradation of forest. Severe fragmentation is certain since suitable habitat is already fragmented across the range of the species. If the AOO was known to be below 2,000km<sup>2</sup> this species would qualify for Vulnerable under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and it is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Igneocnemis incisa</em> is only definitely known from Luzon in the Philippines (Gapud 2006, Gassmann &amp; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2002, Lieftinck 1981, Villanueva <em>et al</em>. 2009). It has a wide but scattered distribution in northern and central Luzon. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen &amp; Muller 1997 recorded this species from Mindoro based on a female specimen but Gassmann &amp; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2002) raised doubts over this record and concluded that there was not enough evidence that <em>I. incisa </em>occurs on Mindoro. The assessor is aware of records from at least 23 locations but it has only been possible to assign separate coordinates to 21 of these for mapping purposes. Some locations are within protected areas, for instance Mount Banahaw and the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. Despite the relatively wide range of the species the AOO is not likely to be large (since much of the suitable habitat has already been lost within the species range), quite likely around or less than 2,000km<sup>2</sup> and is inferred to be declining due to continuing loss of forest.</p>", "population": "<p>All that can be said with the available data is that some decline in overall population will be occurring as a result of clearance of forest throughout the range of the species and that severe fragmentation is certain.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species occurs at low densities \u201cat forest seepages, small streams and springs\u201d Villanueva <em>et al. </em>(2009: 73).
