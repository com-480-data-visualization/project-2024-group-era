Only recently a population was discovered in northern Zambia by Jens Kipping in 2014. Despite several surveys in northern Zambia by Jens Kipping and a survey in southern DRC by KD Dijkstra, it was never recorded at another place (see also Dijkstra &amp; Clausnitzer 2014). The species might be highly seasonal and elusive, but cannot be common. Because of the surveys done, the scarce records, we precautionarily list this species as Endangered (EN) for the time being, owing to the ongoing habitat destruction all over Africa (deforestation, water pollution, extraction of water, destruction of wetlands).", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from one location within Zambia on the Democratic Republic of Congo border only.
