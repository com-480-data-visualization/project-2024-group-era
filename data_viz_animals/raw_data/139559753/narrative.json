It is not clear if the species is present in any protected areas. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it might not be particularly large, quite possibly less than or not much more than 2,000 km\u00b2 and will be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The overall population is believed to already be severely fragmented. The species would qualify for Vulnerable status if its AOO was known to be below 2,000 km\u00b2 and is therefore assessed as NT.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Igneocnemis fuligifrons</em> is endemic to the Philippines where it is known from Basilan, Dinagat, Leyte, Mindanao, Panaon and Siargao (Cayasan <em>et al</em>. 2013, Gassmann and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2002, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 1991, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen pers. comm. 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.
