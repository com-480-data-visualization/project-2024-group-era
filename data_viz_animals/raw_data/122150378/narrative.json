{"name": "122150378", "result": [{"species_id": 122150378, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Amphicnemis triplex</em> is known from Central Kalimantan where it appears to be confined to peat swamp forest and associated peripheral forest formations; threats exist to all such habitats in the province; it may already be extinct at one locality, but this requires confirmation. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of the species is not possible with the available data, but if it is confined to Central Kalimantan is likely to be less than 15,000km<sup>2</sup>, probably considerably less, below the 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> threshold for Vulnerable status, and the AOO will be declining. With at most 7 locations currently known, inferred declines in overall population, AOO and quality and extent of suitable habitat, and threats at all locations the species is close to qualifying for Vulnerable status under criterion D2 and B2ab(ii,iii) (would qualify if its AOO was known to be less than 2,000km<sup>2</sup>) and is assessed as Near Threatened accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Amphicnemis triplex</em> is endemic to Borneo, where it is only known from Central Kalimantan (Dow 2014). About seven locations are known. One of the known locations (Ampah, the type locality) may no longer support the species (an inhabitant of that area told the assessor that no forest remains there, but this requires verification). The species appears to be confined to peat swamp forest and associated peripheral forest formations and its area of occupancy (AOO) is therefore constrained by the remaining area of such habitat in the province, and based on the figures in Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2016 (considering pristine and degraded peat swamp forest) is therefore less than about 15,000km<sup>2</sup>, probably considerably less because the species does not appear to be present in all apparently suitable habitat. The species is recorded from Sebangau National Park (where forest fires have already degraded parts of the species\u2019 habitat). Two of the other locations enjoy some measure of protection because of their Orangutan populations, but to the assessors knowledge this protection is not formal and will effectively vanish if and when scientists and others working on the Orangutans are no longer present in the areas. The AOO and quality and extent of suitable habitat of this species are certainly declining.</p>", "population": "<p>This species can be moderately abundant where it occurs, but beyond this little can be said except that at least some decline to the overall population must have occurred and be ongoing due to loss of lowland forest within its range.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species appears to be confined to peat swamp forest and associated peripheral forest formations. The species has only been found in old growth forest (apart from one record of a female found in a house in Sampit), however the forest has been disturbed at all known locations.</p>", "threats": "The main threat to this species will be from loss of peat swamp forest and associated peripheral forest formations through conversion to oil palm, fires, cutting for timber by local people with little or no other source of income, clearance for agriculture and possibly other reasons. At least one of these threats exists at every known location.", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More data are needed on the distribution of this species. It would undoubtedly benefit from protection of additional areas of lowland swamp forest in Central Kalimantan.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
