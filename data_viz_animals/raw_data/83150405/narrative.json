It is probably a very narrow habitat specialist which most likely breeds in phytotelmata. There is no sufficient information on the population size and trend, but the species is assessed for the moment as Endangered because of its restricted range, occurrence in a small number of locations, and potential threats (timber harvest, logging, fire).", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Pohnpei Island, Federal States of Micronesia.", "population": "Paulson and Buden (2003) record this species occasionally from a wide elevation range. It is possibly widely distributed around the island, but not encountered with high number of individuals. Therefore, the population trend is assessed as unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Paulson and Buden (2003) record this species is an inhabitant of wet forests in and around fast-flowing streams. It is unclear if the species breeds in these streams. As Lieftinck (1962) described a <em>Teinobasis </em>naiad from phytotelmata, Paulson and Buden (2003) consider <em>T. nigrolutea</em>&#160;as the most likely species with such type of behaviour.", "threats": "If the species is proven to breed in phytotelmata, then the deforestation would be a serious threat to its existence.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures in place for this species. Further research is needed to establish the population size and trends.", "usetrade": null}]}
