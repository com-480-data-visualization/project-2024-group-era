Two of the known localities are very close to the border with Laos, so the species should be looked for in that country as well as in Viet Nam. One of the known locations is within the Sao La Nature Reserve. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, however the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat to at least some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2, possibly smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2. Strict application of the IUCN Red List Criteria place this species in Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iii)). However, given the likelihood that the species is more widely distributed than is currently known, it is to be hoped that reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible once more information becomes available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Heliogomphus aluoiensis</em> is known from three localities in Central Viet Nam (Karube <em>et al. </em>2020).
