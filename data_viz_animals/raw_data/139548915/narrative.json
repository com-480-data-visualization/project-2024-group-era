An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but if the species is genuinely confined to Calayan then the AOO will be less than 500 km\u00b2 because that of the island is. Ongoing declines in AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are inferred from loss of forest on Calayan and with only a single location known the species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and, taking a reasonable precautionary approach, is assessed accordingly. Additional data from Calayan may allow reassessment to a lower threat category in the future, but given the small AOO and definite threats it is very unlikely that Least Concern status will ever be appropriate (and therefore Data Deficient is not an appropriate assessment) unless the species is found on other islands in the Philippines.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Diplacina guentherpetersi </em>is only known from the type series of two males from one location in Calayan Island in the Philippines (Villanueva 2012). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, if the species is genuinely confined to Calayan then its AOO will be less than 500 km\u00b2 because the entire area of the island is around 500 km\u00b2. Considerable deforestation is evident on Calayan in satellite images, especially in coastal areas and because of this an ongoing decline in the AOO of this species is inferred.</p>", "population": "<p>This does not appear to be a common species.

The water is clear and cold with moderate flow. The substrate consists of coarse sand and gravel with some mud along the non-moving portion. The collected specimens were found perching on exposed rocks and boulders along the river.\u201d It is likely that the species is forest-dependent.

Protection of habitat where the species occurs is highly desirable. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
