The assessors are aware of records from 13 locations, but seven of these date from the colonial period. There are clusters of locations at Ujung Kulon National Park in the extreme west of Java, and on and near to Nusa Kambangan Island, with a few scattered locations in between. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but given that little low land forest remains in Java, there is no reason to believe that the AOO is greater than 2,000 km\u00b2. Moreover, the AOO, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is &gt;20,000 km\u00b2.
