{"name": "118040701", "result": [{"species_id": 118040701, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The entire distribution area of this species faces intense pressure for agricultural use, the construction of dams and urban development. Both the extent of occurrence (EOO: 1407 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (AOO: 12 km<sup>2</sup>) are small, and all individuals are concentrated in one threat-based location. This, together with deforestation for the settlement of farms, is deteriorating the habitat quality of this species. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from Lara State in western Venezuela. It has been collected in Quediche Stream and Puricaure Swamp in the basin of the Tocuyo River, which drains towards the Caribbean Sea.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate a population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species has been collected in streams, temporary creeks and in the reservoirs of dams in dry to semi-arid environments (Garc\u00eda-Alzate <em>et al. </em>2008).", "threats": "The threat to this species comes from habitat loss, associated with the settlement of urban areas, small cattle farms and plantations of potatoes and lettuce among others, in addition to the presence of several small dams&#160;(Oliveira-Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010).", "conservationmeasures": "The species is not known from any protected areas, but clearly there is a need for improved habitat protection at sites where it is known to occur.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
