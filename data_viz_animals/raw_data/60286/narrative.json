The species is unknown from the karstic western half of the island where few open freshwater bodies are found. Previously, this species was assessed as Least Concern (assessment date 2006), because there was no observation of any population trend or more recent threats, e.g. road construction and increase in water extraction. The species is known only from 25 records from 18 locations and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 550 km\u00b2 (Haghier mountains). The area of occupancy (AOO) 80 km\u00b2.&#160;The species is close to qualifying for the category VU or even EN under criterion B1 and B2, however, the number of locations is larger than 10 and the population is not severely fragmented. Decline of the quality of its habitat as a consequence of water extraction and pollution has also been observed in the lowlands where tourism concentrates and is rapidly developing. It is therefore listed as Near Threatened. Due to the endemicity and small range of the species, future predicted impacts by infrastructural development on Socotra Island will have negative effects. To assess a future change in the conservation status of the Socotra Bluet monitoring of population trends and water quality and quantity are recommended.</p><p></p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Azuragrion granti</em> is endemic to Socotra Island, Yemen (Van Damme 2010).
