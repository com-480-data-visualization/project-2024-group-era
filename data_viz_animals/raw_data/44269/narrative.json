{"name": "44269", "result": [{"species_id": 44269, "taxonomicnotes": "Four species of the genus <em>Burnupia</em> have been described from eastern Africa; two species from the highlands and two from the large rift lakes. <em>Burnupia stuhlmanni </em>is the species that was described from Lake Victoria and the Victoria Nile. The taxonomic relationship between these four species and with the widespread <em>B. caffra </em>are unknown. If these are distinct species or ecophenotypic adaptations to exceptional conditions (highlands, rift lakes) needs further investigation.", "rationale": "That<em> Burnupia stuhlmanni</em> is a distinct species currently is an assumption, not based on reliable morphological or molecular evidence. We project a 25% population decline in the next 10 years based on the existing and potential threats on the habitat (C. Lange pers. comm. 2016). Considering its high sensitivity to pollution and global warming, it may become extinct rapidly. This species is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to East Africa. It is found in Lake Victoria, from Kisumu in Kenya to the Victoria Nile in Uganda (Brown 1994). Data from this author suggests that this species is common and abundant in Kisumu, but during a 2002-2004 survey in Winam Bay this species was not recovered (Lange <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). However, C. Lange (pers. comm. 2016) states that it is still common.", "population": "No information is available on the population but currently it is cited as abundant.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "It is found on stones at the lakes edge (Brown 1994).", "threats": "Like all limpets this species is sensitive to all disturbances that lower the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water column. Additionally, drought due to climate change could threaten this species.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures have been implemented.", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
