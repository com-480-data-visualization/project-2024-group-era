{"name": "139347150", "result": [{"species_id": 139347150, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Pericnemis lestoides</em> is known from at least 12 locations in Bucas Grande, Dinagat, Siargao and the northeast of Mindanao in the Philippines. Threats exist across the range of the species and the overall population is believed to be severely fragmented. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data will be less than 500 km\u00b2. The AOO will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely less than 5,000 km\u00b2. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed as such.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Pericnemis lestoides</em> is known from Bucas Grande, Dinagat, Siargao and the northeast of Mindanao in the Philippines (Needham and Gyger 1939; Lieftinck 1957; Villanueva 2009, 2011, in preparation). The assessor is aware of records from 12 locations to which it has been possible to assign separate coordinates. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data will be less than 500 km\u00b2. The AOO will be declining due to loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) based on known localities is 3,827 km\u00b2; the EOO based on occupied HydroBASIN areas is 7,117<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"> km\u00b2.<br/></p>", "population": "<p>In the assessor\u2019s experience this is a locally occurring species and typically only occurs at low densities where it is found. Beyond this all that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is suspected due to loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range and that severe fragmentation appears certain for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Little is known on the habitat requirements of this species but it is certainly at least partly forest-dependent. It has been found at small streams running through coconut plantations (albeit with some original vegetation at the streams themselves) and also in areas with no streams or other freshwater except in phytotelmata. It may be a phytotelmata breeding species. Although it clearly has some tolerance to disturbance it does not appear to be able to survive at locations without substantial shade. An ongoing decline in the extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred from loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threats to this species will be from clearance of forest for agriculture or as a result of logging (small scale within its range nowadays) and mining. For example for Dinagat Island BirdLife International (2019), based on data from 2001, state that \u201cThe timber on Dinagat is of poor quality, but wood-cutting and encroachment into the forests for kaingin [slash and burn agriculture] and illegal commercial logging are reported to occur there. The upgrading of a road through the centre of the island could increase the rate of encroachment in the future. There have been reports of chromite mining on a hill adjacent to Mt Kambilio.\u201d In fact recent satellite images show extensive mining operations at several locations within the IBA and apparently much of the island is under mining concessions (Villanueva 2009). Small, illegal mining operations are common in the remaining forests of Dinagat and pollute streams with toxic chemicals, after which almost all Odonata vanish.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for protection of habitat where it occurs and for more information on its habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
