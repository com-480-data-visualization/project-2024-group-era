Area of Occupancy (AOO) and Extent of Occurrence (EOO) are conservatively estimated to be 8 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is assigned to two threat-based locations. Total population size and population trend are unknown, but this species is abundant where it occurs. The primary threat to this species is deforestation associated with cattle ranching and plantation agriculture, which had led to the extirpation of some seasonal killifishes that formerly inhabited the area. Despite uncertainties regarding the direct impact of regionally pervasive threats at the two collection localities from which this species has bene reported, it is feasible to assume that continued expansion of such activities could result in the rapid extirpation of <em>C. oticus</em>. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cynolebias oticus </em>is known only from the Verde River drainage, near the village of Pinda\u00ed in Bahia, Brazil (Costa 2014).
