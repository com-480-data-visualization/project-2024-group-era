Modifications caused by land use change, urbanization, road construction, and dams for irrigation in agriculture are the main threats of this species. There is a single threat-based location based on these threats. At present, it is unknown as to whether the threats are causing continuing declines. However, it is possible that they could push the species to becoming Endangered or Critically Endangered in a very short time period. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in the R\u00edo Guyraugu\u00e1, tributary to the Monday River, R\u00edo Paran\u00e1 Basin in Paraguay (Uj and Gery 1989, Fricke <em>et al. </em>2020).", "population": "This is a rare species, known from a single site based on the available literature. The population documentation is null. Research and monitoring is needed to know population composition, structure, size and trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in R\u00edo Guyraugu\u00e1, tributary to the Monday River (Uj and Gery 1989). There are no data about its habitat preferences and the information about its ecology is null.", "threats": "The distribution is located on a main road or highway in Paraguay and also in a region of importance for the agriculture and cattle sectors. Modifications caused by land use change, urbanization, road construction, and dams for irrigation in agriculture are the main threats to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no research, monitoring and planning known to be conducted. Research is necessary into its taxonomy, population, ecology and threats.", "usetrade": "This is a rare species, but could be used in the ornamental trade, as are most tetras."}]}
