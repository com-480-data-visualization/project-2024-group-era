{"name": "223958687", "result": [{"species_id": 223958687, "taxonomicnotes": "There may be two largely allopatric species embedded in this taxon, but without more collections it is going to be hard to tell. Both forms are certainly uncommon and habitat-restricted (A. Wild pers. comm. 2023).", "rationale": "<em>Linepithema aztecoides</em>&#160;has an area of occupancy of 88km<sup>2</sup>. Its habitat is mostly restricted to cerrado edge, which is projected to continue to be degraded due to cattle ranching and agricultural expansion. This species is not severely fragmented and is found in many localities. There is no population or monitoring data available and so there is no evidence for extreme fluctuations in EOO, AOO, locations/subpopulations or the number of mature individuals. Therefore, the species is listed as Near Threatened (NT).", "geographicrange": "<em>Linepithema aztecoides</em> has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 3,566,560 km<sup>2</sup>, and minimum area of occupancy (AOO) of 88 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and can be found in Colombia, Paraguay and Brazil. The majority of known localities fall within central and south-eastern Brazil, particularly in states Minas Gerais and S\u00e3o Paulo.", "population": "There is no recorded information on the population size and trends for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<em>Linepithema aztecoides </em>has been collected<em>&#160;</em>from the edge of humid subtropical low forest bordering a small cerrado and from cerrados and riparian gallery forests (Wild 2007). It appears to be largely restricted to these two habitat types. It tends to be found at low elevations and on low vegetation.", "threats": "Very little is known about the threats that may be affecting this species. However, this species is found mostly in cerrado habitats and especially on the edge of cerrado. It can therefore be inferred that this species is likely to be at risk due to habitat degradation for agriculture - largely for mechanised soy farming (Fearnside 2001) - and cattle ranching (Dick <em>et al. </em>2021). These threats pose a significant threat to the cerrado habitat more generally and will be most likely to affect edges first. A study by Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. (2022) predicted that if no laws are put in place to protect cerrado and if habitat loss accelerates, more than 60% of the cerrado vegetation could be lost by 2050, which would have a severe negative impact on this species.", "conservationmeasures": "In a small portion of its range, <em>Linepithema aztecoides</em> exists within protected areas, including Panga Ecological Station. Ensuring that habitat heterogeneity persists in the Cerrado region has been shown to benefit ant diversity (Pacheco and Vasconcelos 2011), and so could be of value to this species. Further research into the distribution, ecology, population size and trend would be useful, as well as to investigate what potential threats it may face.", "usetrade": "There is no information currently on the use or trade of this species."}]}
