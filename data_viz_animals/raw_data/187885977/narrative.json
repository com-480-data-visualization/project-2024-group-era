The species was described from Igarap\u00e9 Caipirinha in Ayapu\u00e1 lake, with paratypes in Igarap\u00e9 Dos Caetanos in river Ipixuna drainage&#160;(Carvalho and Reis 2020). The species&#160;is reported in two localities with an elevational distribution range from 54-63 meters above sea level.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated at 10,661 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 440 km<sup>2</sup>. Based on the future threat of gold mining in the region, there is one potential threat-based location.<br/><br/>The geographic attributes for&#160;<em>Acanthobunocephalus scruggsi</em>&#160;in this assessment were compiled, arranged and reviewed from the following sources: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2020), FishNet2 (Fishnet2 2020), FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2019), SiB Colombia (SiB Colombia 2020) and SpeciesLink (SpeciesLink 2020).", "population": "There are no adequate records about&#160;<em>Acanthobunocephalus scruggsi&#160;</em>that allow an estimate of the total population size.

The species&#160;<em>A. scruggsi</em>&#160;can reach a maximum size of 2.2 cm SL (Carvalho and Reis 2020).", "threats": "No threats are known to be currently affecting <em>Acanthobunocephalus scruggsi</em>. However, the future advance of gold mining in the region&#160;will be a threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no known laws, regulations and educational programs specifically oriented to its protection. In the lowland of Purus rivers this species probably inhabits different protected areas, such as Resex Canutama, Parna Nascentes do Lago Jari, Rebio do Abufari and RDS Piagacu-Purus (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020). Awareness and communications are necessary. Research into the life history, population trend and habitat condition is recommended. The extinction risk of <em>Acanthobunocephalus scruggsi</em> was  preliminarily assessed as Least Concern by Carvalho and Reis (2020),  who recognized its small distribution area but no significant threats to  the species.", "usetrade": "The use of the species <em>Acanthobunocephalus scruggsi</em> are unknown."}]}
