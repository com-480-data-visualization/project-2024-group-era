The assessors are aware of records from 39 individual sites, but some of these are sufficiently close together that they constitute single threat-defined locations (taking clearance of forest as the main threat), so about 33 locations are known. The occurrence of the species in the northern part of its range around Kandy hasn\u2019t been confirmed in the last 50 years. Some locations are within protected areas (for example, Sinharaja Forest Reserve). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible, but with the available data it will be below 500 km\u00b2. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 5,819 km\u00b2 (based on a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around the known data points); its maximum EOO is 8,329 km\u00b2 (based on an MCP around the HydroBASINS known to be occupied by this species).<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"></span></p>", "population": "<p>This species can be quite common where it occurs but an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss and degradation of forest within its range.

Out of that, only about 445 km\u00b2 are thought to be undisturbed, which represents only 2% of the original extent of natural forest (Erdelen 1988, Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2000). As shown by Mattsson <em>et al</em>. (2012), forest clearing and encroachment continues, mainly by small-scale farmers for rice and tea cultivation. The forest cover of Sri Lanka has decreased by half in the past 50 years, and the future of the island\u2019s forests remains precarious. </p>  <p>Although the trend of forest loss is less drastic recently, increasing human population pressure and forest clearance for infrastructure projects and agricultural expansion remain the main threats to rich endemic biodiversity of Sri Lanka's wet zone. Habitat loss and encroachment in the central and southwestern part of Sri Lanka is also caused by the destruction of buffer forest corridors along streams, river impoundment, water extraction for irrigation and consumption, soil erosion, siltation, over-use of agricultural chemicals and careless pollution of rivers and streams. These threats all actually or potentially affect <em>Ceylonosticta nietneri </em>and climate change may also be negatively impacting its habitats.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The following steps are needed for the affective conservation of this species and other Odonata endemic to Sri Lanka: </p>  <p>(1) Enforce and supplement existing conservation measures in protected areas. In many cases the protective legislation doesn\u2019t stop the gross destruction of the habitat with the consequent loss of species. Agricultural expansion in forest areas slowly but consistently encroaches important areas by the cutting of undergrowth and small scale logging. When vegetation is removed or damaged around streams and seeps, there are negative effects on many dragonfly species. </p>  <p>(2) Establish new protected areas in the central and southwestern part of Sri Lanka and enlarge existing ones. Several patches of rainforests or partly degraded areas with exceptionally rich fauna and flora are excluded from the current protected area network. The conservation focus should be on the wet zone and montane areas where the majority of the island\u2019s endemics are found. </p>  <p>(3) Enforce existing legislation and legislate additional protection for the smallest streams, rivulets and forest corridors in the wet zone. Streams, rivulets and forest corridors need legislation to prohibit the diversion of streams and clearcutting from the edges since this destroys the dragonfly habitats. Buffer zones of natural vegetation, especially around swamps and flowing waters, should be mandatory by legislation. </p>  <p>(4) Enforce measures to avoid siltation and unnatural flow regimes of running waters. Damming streams or piping springs should be minimized, especially in key dragonfly conservation areas. Water extraction for consumption and irrigation should be sustainable, taking into account the integrity of the habitat and its biodiversity. </p>  <p>(5) Minimize the chemical and organic pollution of water habitats. The impact of the over-use of various agricultural chemicals and insecticides in Sri Lanka is virtually unknown, but surely has a strong negative impact on species, including humans. </p>  <p>(6) Restore degraded areas in key locations. The natural potential for restoration is very high in partly degraded habitats, and a favourable conservation status can be restored in a relatively short time with simple measures. </p>  <p>(7) Conduct comprehensive odonatological faunistic work in protected areas of the central and southwestern part of the island, including regular monitoring as a subsequent step. The amount of much-needed new knowledge gathered in this way would be immense. Without this baseline information, specific conservation guidelines are hard to elaborate and effective conservation measures on the local level cannot be undertaken. </p>  <p>(8) Raise awareness on the threat status of the endemic dragonfly fauna of Sri Lanka among local scientists, students, nature tour guides and naturalists, as well as relevant nature conservation authorities and organisations, both locally and internationally.</p>  <p>(9) As voucher specimen are vital in confirming the identity of newly discovered populations and as additional research is required on threatened endemic dragonfly species, it is highly recommended supporting and encourage taxonomic and faunistic work as important conservation actions. A more convenient process of obtaining permits from a centralized permit issuing agency should be enforced in future.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
