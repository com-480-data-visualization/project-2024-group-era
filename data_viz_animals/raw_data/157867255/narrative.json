{"name": "157867255", "result": [{"species_id": 157867255, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from one restricted location, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 2,389 m to 2,440 m bsl. As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO), and has been found at one location, the plausible threat of future anthropogenic influence from deep-sea mining in this site justifies the assessment of the species as Vulnerable (VU D2). Whilst no licences have been granted to date, this vent field is not protected and if mining were to be approved, the projected decline in the extent and quality of habitat would drive this species to Critically Endangered (CR) very rapidly. Therefore, an urgent reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements or if there are future changes to the prices of relevant commodities, whereby the assessment would probably increase to Endangered (EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)).", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to one location at hydrothermal vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Pacific Ocean. This location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with biologically and geologically coherent identity. Any vent fields within this location therefore also have common exposure to relevant potential threats. This location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Canada. The species is currently known from one vent field with active black smokers and diffuse venting located at depths of 2,389 to 2,440 m bsl, namely the Middle Valley Bent Hill Massive Sulfide vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge (McLean 1993). This species is present over a small area at this vent field.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (McLean 1993).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2,389 m to 2,440 m bsl.", "threats": "This species is known to inhabit one hydrothermal vent field. This location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Canada and as such, is not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the location is remote and at depth, the impact of mining is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. Whilst no mining licences have been granted for the area to date, this vent field would be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining were to be permitted by the Canadian government.&#160;There is currently no protection for the one location that this species inhabits, the Middle Valley Bent Hill Massive Sulfide vent field, leaving open the possibility for the future implementation of mining licences at this location. We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licences to be granted as a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at the Middle Valley Bent Hill Massive Sulfide&#160;vent field. We recommend that specific national/international&#160;legislation is required for the protection of deep-sea habitats and resources. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the Juan de Fuca Ridge.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
