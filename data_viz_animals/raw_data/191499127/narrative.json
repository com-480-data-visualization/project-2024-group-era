There is no information about the population, but there is a plausible future threat from habitat destruction and associated changes in the water bodies where this species is, which could significantly impact the species. If such a threat became active, the species would likely immediately qualify for listing as Critically Endangered. Therefore, this species is currently assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from Zahamena National Park in Madagascar (Bistr\u00f6m <em>et al.</em> 2015). The extent of occurrence (EOO) and the area of occupancy (AOO)&#160;of the known localities are both estimated to be around 8 km<sup>2</sup>; but if a hydrobasin layer is used the EOO could be up to c.1,000km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;Due to habitat loss, the species is considered to occur at around two locations.", "population": "There is no information about the population trend of this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in fast running rivers and streams (Bistr\u00f6m&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). While the surrounding forests may be impacted by deforestation, it is not known if there is a decline in the immediate habitat of this species.", "threats": "The forests in Madagascar are impacted by deforestation from illegal logging, fires and conversion of land for agriculture, which may impact streams and rivers where this species occurs. However, the extent to which these threats impact this species are also unknown.", "conservationmeasures": "Further research is needed to establish how localised the species is to the area, and to find additional specimens. More information will help inform potential conservation efforts. The species occurs in a protected area and is found at relatively high altitudes, which offers some protection, but monitoring of the area is recommended.", "usetrade": "This species is not known to be used or traded."}]}
