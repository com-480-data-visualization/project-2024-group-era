The species is known from western piedmont streams within the upper Guaviare yo upper Meta drainage systems. The records include rivers Orotoy, Acac\u00edas, Guayuriba, Cusiana, Guatiqu\u00eda, Caney, Camoa and Guejar, among others (Usma <em>et al</em>. 2016, DoNascimiento <em>et al.</em> 2018, Urbano-Bonilla <em>et al.</em> 2018).

The size of the population is considered to be large.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "This is an obligate inhabitant of fast-flowing, sometimes high gradient, headwater streams and minor tributaries. Substrates are normally of bedrock with scattered jumbles of rocks and boulders, and while riparian vegetation and submerged leaf litter are common, true aquatic plants are not usually present. The most favourable habitats contain clear, well-oxygenated water, which facilitates the development of a rich biofilm carpeting submerged surfaces, although turbidity, volume, and chemistry can change rapidly and often due to sometimes daily rainfall (Ballen 2011). It is possible that it has a periodic reproductive strategy associated with the rainy season.&#160;<em>Chaetostoma formosae</em> can reach 102.6 mm standard length (Ballen 2011).", "threats": "The habitat for&#160;<em>Chaetostoma formosae</em>&#160;is threatened by progressive degradation in several drainages resulting from deforestation, primarily for oil palm crops and oil exploitation. There are many urban centres (e.g. Villavicencio, Yopal) in the distribution that discharge effluents to rivers. Land-use change within these catchments is likely to alter hydrology, sediment transport, and habitat conditions within river systems, with adverse consequences for aquatic biodiversity\u2029 (Romero-Ru\u00edz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Urbano<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014).", "conservationmeasures": "There are some conservations sites and protected areas that cover sections of the rivers&#160;where the species <em>Chaetostoma formosae</em> is reported (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020): National Natural Park Sierra de la Macarena and DMI Ariari-Guayabero. Habitat protection in the most impacted drainages is recommended, as well as awareness and communications.&#160;It is necessary to research the actual conditions and trends for the population size and distribution, threats and habitat.", "usetrade": "There are no known uses for the species"}]}
