The main threats take place in Yaracuy River, which has been polluted with waste waters from urban, industrial and agricultural areas. Additionally, some of the tributaries have been blocked by the construction of dams, and the deforestation of riparian forests is widespread (Rodr\u00edguez-Olarte<em> et al. </em>2011).", "conservationmeasures": "Around 30% of the distribution is within the national parks of Yurubi and Cueva de la Quebrada del Toro. However, most of it occurs in highly degraded areas. This species would benefit from habitat restoration and better information on distribution, abundance and population trends.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
