Threats exist throughout the range of the species and the overall population is believed to already be severely fragmented. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data will be less than 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criterion B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed as such. It is to be hoped that when more data become available that re-assessment to Vulnerable will be possible, but it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to place it in Least Concern.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta lymetta</em> is endemic to Mindanao in the Philippines (Cowley 1936, van Tol 2005, Villanueva and Cahilog 2013).
