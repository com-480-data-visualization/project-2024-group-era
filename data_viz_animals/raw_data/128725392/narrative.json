It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 16,800 km<sup>2</sup>, occurs in three threat-based locations, and is experiencing continuing decline in habitat and its population size. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "<em>Schistura pakistancia</em>&#160;is distributed in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It has been recorded in Muslim Bagh in Baluchistan province in the Zhob River basin, a tributary of the Gomal River which itself is a tributary of the Indus (Mirza <em>et al. </em>1981, Mirza 1998). It has also been recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the Aronai stream in the area of Matta, Swat and in Wana rivers near Ashraf Khel and Mughal Khel (Mirza <em>et al.&#160;</em>1995, M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "population": "The major threats to this species across its distribution range are severe drought and construction of Gomal Zam dam. The population declines in the past is due to severe drought, while into the future both drought and the dam will affect the population. The decline in population is suspected to be at most 25% in the next 10 years.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This is a carnivorous species that inhabits clear, shallow and cold, running, freshwater streams with stony beds (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "threats": "<em>Schistura pakistanica </em>faces the threats of&#160;drought and the construction of the Zam dam, which causes a decline in both habitat area and quality (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "conservationmeasures": "A thorough survey of the life history of this species is needed, alongside public education and awareness raising. The species is not protected by any law.", "usetrade": "The species is not in use or in trade."}]}
