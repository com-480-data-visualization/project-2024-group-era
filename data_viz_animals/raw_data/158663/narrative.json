The species is dependent on the presence of forest and may have declined due to the reduction of the forest cover on the island. Frequent bush fires supposedly have a serious impact on the species. The Near Threatened assessment is based on the species' small area of occupancy (AOO is less than 200 km\u00b2), an extent of occurrence that may be less than 20,000 km\u00b2, and continuing decline in habitat. Since the number of known locations for the species is currently close to 90, it cannot be placed in a threatened category. Further research is required on the status of this species.", "geographicrange": "<em>Caledopteryx sarasini </em>is endemic to Grande Terre, New Caledonia.
