{"name": "161317981", "result": [{"species_id": 161317981, "taxonomicnotes": "There are no notable issues.", "rationale": "This is a range-restricted endemic species from the Free State Province, South Africa. There are two locations. One of the locations faces the threat of future urbanisation, which could rapidly impact the species. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Vulnerable under criterion D.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Free State Province in South Africa, from near Clarens to the Golden Gate Highlands National Park.", "population": "Population counts have revealed fewer than 2,000 adults per season.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "It occurs in moist habitats at the foot of south-facing slopes of mountains, in shallow gullies or on the banks of streams. Larval host plant grows on bare areas very close to water's edge.", "threats": "Although the taxon occurs in a national park, it is not necessarily safe from decline in numbers in the near future. The possible impact on its grassland habitat by bush encroachment by the indigenous tree <em>Leucosidea sericea</em>&#160;is a problem in the area and should be investigated. Fire regimes and the siting of hiking trails have to be well considered. Threats to the ecology of a possible associated ant species make the taxon a habitat specialist, consequently with a broader suite of possible threats. The ecosystem status of the habitat, from a vegetation perspective, is listed as Least Threatened.&#160;The subpopulation at the type locality (Clarens) faces numerous anthropogenic threats in future, in particular urbanisation.", "conservationmeasures": "The taxon occurs in a national park, but appropriate fire management of the habitat is required. Additional research may be useful.", "usetrade": null}]}
