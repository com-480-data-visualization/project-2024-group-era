Despite being a conspicuous insect occurring in a reasonably surveyed area (both the Ghanan and Togolese side of the area have been surveyed) it has not been rediscovered. The impacts of the deforestation for agriculture are unknown, but based on the fact that other species within the genus are mostly forest dependent it is believed that this could be a threat to the species. Based on this threat the species is estimated to occur in just one location. The species is therefore listed as Critically Endangered, and could possibly be Extinct.", "geographicrange": "The species is known only from Togolese type locality, \"Misah\u00f6he\" (forested hill near present-day Kpalime (Baumann, 1898)).
