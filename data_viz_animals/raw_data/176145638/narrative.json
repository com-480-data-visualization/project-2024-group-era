The southernmost records of the distribution of species are from material of MNHN fish collection identified under the name of <em>G. leopardus</em>, but these require confirmation since it represents a considerable expansion of the range of distribution. Notwithstanding, these localities are within the expected distribution region of the species and thus probably represent occupancy areas for it.
