{"name": "109723794", "result": [{"species_id": 109723794, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species is endemic to Tominanga River in Sulawesi, where it is only found on hard substrate in the river with an extent of occurrence (EOO) and an area of occupancy (AOO) both of 8 km<sup>2</sup>. This is counted as a single location based on the threats of nickel mining, hydro-electric power installations, logging, and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population, which are causing a decline in habitat quality through siltation and changes to natural water levels. It is also very vulnerable to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em>&#160;sp.) &#160;through the Malili lakes system. This species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered based on its extremely limited distribution and deterioration of habitats.", "geographicrange": "<p>The species&#160;is endemic to the Tominanga River, which is part of the Malili Lakes system in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and connects Lake Mahalona to downstream Lake Towuti.<br/></p>", "population": "<p>There is no current population information available for this species although it has been reported as abundant (von Rintelen <em>et al.</em> 2007). An overall population decline of at least 50% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder <em>et al</em>. 2012) and are thought to have caused the decline of <em>Tylomelania</em> populations through predation of small adults and juveniles (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to the Tominanga River, where they are predicted to cause population declines similar to those seen in Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in a freshwater river and is a hard substrate dweller on rocks, gravel and wood.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic.<br/><br/>Many species of <em>Tylomelania</em> are being collected for the aquarium pet trade.&#160;<em>Tylomelania</em>&#160;<em>wesseli </em>does not seem to be traded yet, though, and is unlikely to become a major target.</p><p>Finally, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids, <em>Colossoma</em> sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and have unknown but potentially serious consequences through predation of small adults and juveniles (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012), as recent surveys in Lake Matano have found only large individuals of large <em>Tylomelania</em> species remaining (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This species is particularly vulnerable due to its small size. They have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to the River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of at least 50% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>No conservation plans are currently in place for this species,&#160;but protection of its known localities and habitats is needed, along with invasive species control. Research is also needed into the population dynamics, ecology and the threats to this species.</p>", "usetrade": "There is no use or trade information available for this species. Many <em>Tylomelania </em>species of the Malili lakes are collected and traded as aquarium pets, however <em>T. wesseli&#160;</em>has not yet been conspicuously traded."}]}
