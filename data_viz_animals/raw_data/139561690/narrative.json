The type location is near to, possibly inside, the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary and in any case the species is likely to occur somewhere&#160; within this sanctuary (but see threats). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is likely to be small and with the presently available data can be assumed to be below 500km<sup>2</sup>. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest in the part of Mindanao where the species occurs. In most circumstance this assessor would only place such a poorly known species in Data Deficient but <em>Igneocnemis</em> species should not be particularly hard to find where present so the species is likely to be genuinely extremely local in occurrence and confined to a small area and<em> </em>the severity of threats to forest-dependent Odonata in Mindanao is such that Least Concern is not likely to ever be justified for this species. It qualifies for Endangered under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly. Whilst it is to be hoped that fresh data will allow re-assessment to a lower threat category it is entirely possible that re-assessment to Critically Endangered will be required.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Igneocnemis pistor</em> is only known from the type series from one locality in south east Mindanao in the Philippines, collected in 1996 (Gassmann &amp; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2002).

Based on information compiled in 2001 BirdLife International (2019) state for the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary: \u201cA combination of kaingin [slash and burn agriculture], commercial agriculture, illegal logging, mining activities and road construction are slowly reducing and fragmenting the remaining natural habitats in this IBA.\u201d There is no evidence that the situation has improved since 2001.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance and for better protection of the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary.
