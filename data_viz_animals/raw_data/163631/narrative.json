Based on the current known distribution, the species should also be looked for in Myanmar. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to at least some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its current known maximum extent of occurrence (EOO), based on the HydroBASINS that known records are from, is 7,997 km\u00b2. The species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)), and also under criterion D (VU D2), because if the species were to be lost from one of the known locations, it would rapidly move into Critically Endangered.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cryptophaea saukra</em> is known from Doi Suthep (a protected area) in Thailand (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2003) and a locality in Yunnan, China (Zhang 2019 unpublished).
