The area of occupancy is estimated at 6-12  km<sup>2</sup>, but the number of locations cannot be determined. The species may  be impacted by the introduced invasive alien species (tilapia and <em>Astyanax </em>species), and to a lesser degree from habitat degradation caused by agricultural run-off. This species' habitat fluctuates naturally, but it  is unclear if there is continuing decline in the extent and quality of  the habitat. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable (VU).", "geographicrange": "<em>Cyprinodon esconditus </em>is a freshwater pupfish species endemic to Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, <span data-original-name=\"Laguna Chichankanab\"><span data-original-name=\"Laguna Chichankanab\">in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.

The habitat of this species varies widely with cycles of 6-8 years with  water level reaching up to 2 m and decreasing to 20-30 cm, and the  flooded area varies between 300 to 3500 hectares (A.
