{"name": "60979", "result": [{"species_id": 60979, "taxonomicnotes": "Previously classified in <i>Protomelas</i> due to lack of knowledge on its melanin pattern when it was described \u2014 only individuals in full blue colouration had been observed.", "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it occurs in rather shallow water, over pure sandy bottoms.&#160;It is, therefore,&#160;vulnerable to being caught with beach seines and its bright blue colouration makes it an easy target for collectors of ornamental fish as well. It is a very popular species in the aquarium hobby and even though it occurs over a rather large area, along a coastline of about 35 km, heavy exploitation is a present threat.&#160;It has an area of occupancy (AOO) of approximately 64 km<sup>2</sup> and there is only one location based on threats of over-fishing by the ornamental fish trade. It is also inferred to have a population decline of around 50% over the last 10 year period. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi. It occurs in the northern part of the lake between Ngara and Chirwa Island.", "population": "The population is in decline.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "It occurs in shallow sandy areas where it feeds from sediment particles that have been expelled through the gills of larger, sand digging species mostly of the genus <em>Taeniolethrinops</em>. Males are not territorial and spawning probably takes place at a temporarily defended site. The maximum total length is about 16 cm.", "threats": "Threats to this species are regular extraction by the ornamental fish trade and subsistence fishing using beach seines.", "conservationmeasures": "No information is available on conservation actions for this species.", "usetrade": "It is regularly collected by the ornamental fish trade. It is also targeted by subsistence fishermen using beach seines."}]}
