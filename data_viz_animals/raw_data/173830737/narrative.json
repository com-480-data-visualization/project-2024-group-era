Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area of Occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is assigned to a single threat-based location. The type locality of this species is contained entirely within Ref\u00fagio de Vida Silvestre Banhado dos Pachecos, which has reduced the immediate likelihood of anthropogenic impacts by preventing habitat modification. However, regional threats include land-use change and pollution associated with intense deforestation, urbanization and agricultural expansion, and could rapidly drive this species into a high threatened category in the future. Therefore, <em>C. notabilis</em> is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cynopoecilus notabilis </em>is known only from its type locality, a temporary pool in the upper portion of the Gravata\u00ed River basin, laguna dos Patos system, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Ferrer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</p>  <p>Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a single 2x2 km grid overlain on the type locality.

Changes to existing protected area boundaries could feasibly result in the extinction of this species if the type locality is lost. Pollutants originating from outside the reserve may also negatively influence habitat quality to such a degree that this species is driven to CR or EX within a short period of time.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The type locality of this species is contained entirely within Ref\u00fagio de Vida Silvestre Banhado dos Pachecos, which has reduced the immediate likelihood of anthropogenic impacts by preventing habitat modification (Ferrer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).
