{"name": "109723745", "result": [{"species_id": 109723745, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>The species is endemic to Lake Matano in Sulawesi, where it is only found on soft substrate with an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 71 km<sup>2</sup>. This is counted as a single location based on the threats of nickel mining, hydro-electric power installations, logging, and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population, which are causing a decline in habitat quality through siltation and changes to natural water levels. It is also vulnerable to predation by invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) within Lake Matano. This species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered based on its extremely limited distribution and deterioration of habitats.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p>The species&#160;is endemic to Lake Matano (164.1 km<sup>2</sup>), which is part of the Malili Lakes system in Sulawesi, Indonesia.</p>", "population": "<p>There is no current population information available for this species but it has previously been reported as abundant where it occurs (T. von Rintelen <em>et al</em>. 2007). While there are no data on population trends in this species, all <em>Tylomelania&#160;</em>species endemic to Lake Matano for which recent observations (2017) exist have declined in abundance, likely due to predation of small adults and juveniles by invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma </em>sp.) introduced to the lake. An overall population decline of at least 50% is predicted to occur in this species due to the continued impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018), based on their impact on closely related species within Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in the permanent freshwater Lake Matano (164.1 km<sup>2</sup>) and is only found on soft substrate.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic. </p>  <p>Many species of <em>Tylomelania</em> are being collected for the aquarium pet trade.&#160;<em>Tylomelania</em>&#160;<em>turriformis </em>does not seem to be traded yet, though, and is unlikely to become a major target.</p><p>Finally, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids,<em> Colossoma </em>sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and have unknown but potentially serious consequences through predation of small adults and juveniles (Herder<em> et al</em>. 2012), as recent surveys in Lake Matano have found only large individuals of large <em>Tylomelania </em>species remaining (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>No conservation plans are currently in place for this species,&#160;but protection of its known localities and habitats is needed, along with invasive species control.
