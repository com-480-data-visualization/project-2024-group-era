Here it is restricted to a naturally fragmented and physicochemically severe habitats where&#160;populations are subject to large and rapid changes in local abundance (\u2018boom and bust\u2019 ecology) due to fragmentation and, presumably, to high rates of genetic drift that accompany its small populations, all as a result of natural extreme and rapid fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and size. This turbulence is worsen by the threat of&#160;agricultural intensification in adjacent basins, that has been linked to decreases in surface-water flows and extensive loss of habitat in the Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas basin. With such threats, <em>Lucania interioris</em>&#160;is thought to inhabit no more than 10 fragmented locations, holding an extent of occurrence of 4,733 km<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Lucania interioris </em>is restricted to the isolated regions of the endorheic Bolson de Cuatro Cienegas biological reserve in Coahulia, Mexico. Within the dessert valley it occurs in three major drainage regions of the basin and is limited primarily to naturally fragmented and physicochemically severe habitats of the valley floor (Miller <em>et al. </em>2005, Carson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Precise localities of this species, as collected by Carson <em>et al. </em>(2015) in 2014, were: R\u00edo Garabatal, Juan Santos, Las Salinas, El Laberinto, Laguna de los Burros, T\u00edo C\u00e1ndido, Los Hundidos and Laguna San Pablo.", "population": "As a whole, little is known for the total population size of <em>Lucania interioris,</em>&#160;as&#160;populations, including those from the remote southeastern basin, remain unstudied (Carson <em>et al.</em> 2015). This species, though abundant in its small distribution area in Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas, comprises many scattered and small populations that are isolated one from each other (H. Espinosa-P\u00e9rez pers. comm<em>.&#160;</em>2019). <br/><br/>Carson <em>et al.</em> (2015) mentioned that the gene flow among most of these populations is interrupted (H. Espinosa-P\u00e9rez &amp; C. Lambarri pers. comm. 2019). Since populations are not connected, some are severely threatened, such as the Garabatal (Eastern Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas) and Mezquites (central Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas) (H. Espinosa-P\u00e9rez &amp; C. Lambarri pers. comm.<em>&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>Populations are known to be subject to large and rapid changes in local abundance (\u2018boom and bust\u2019 ecology) and also presumed high rates of genetic drift that accompany its small populations (Frankham <em>et al.</em> 2002, Allendorf and Luikart 2007).

These habitats are prone to extreme and rapid fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and size, causing large and rapid changes in local abundance (\u2018boom and bust\u2019 ecology), fragmentation and, presumably, to high rates of genetic drift that accompany small populations (Frankham <em>et al.</em> 2002, Allendorf and Luikart 2007). Pools where this species inhabits are already too shallow and water in the marshes fluctuates too much both in water level and physicochemical characteristics for the species to tolerate (H.

This poses a severe threat to the species, given the vulnerable and fragile species natural habitat characterised by ephemeral and intermittent shallow pools already prone to extreme and rapid fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and size (H.
