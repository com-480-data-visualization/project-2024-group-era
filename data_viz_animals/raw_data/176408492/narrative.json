Alonso <em>et al.</em> pers. obs. 2020).", "population": "There are no data available on the population trend of this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species inhabits small creeks with clear water and slow&#160;flow with marginal vegetation being rare or not present in other aquatic environments of the area that, in contrast, present regular flooding and murky waters in summer (Mirande<em> et al.</em> 2004, F. Alonso <em>et al.</em> pers. obs. 2020).", "threats": "The distribution area of this species has been intensively affected by deforestation and crops implantation that could affect the quality and extent of the habitat of this species, increasing sediments and changing the flow regime. Also the use of agro-chemicals in the crops may be affecting the species.", "conservationmeasures": "Part of the population of this species is in a private reserve.", "usetrade": "There are no known uses of this species but other similar small species in the area are occasionally used as bait and so it is likely that this species might be used as bait occasionally too."}]}
