It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 13,006 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 1,748 km<sup>2</sup>. The primary threats are agriculture, deforestation, water intake and sewage and contamination from human populations industries and agriculture. There are four locations and a continuing decline inferred in the area, extent and quality of habitat based on these threats. In particular, contamination for industries is considered severe enough to push the species to becoming Critically Endangered or Extinct in a very short time period.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the upper Bermejo river basin in the Yungas region in north-western Argentina (Mirande <em>et al. </em>2006).", "population": "No data on the trend of the population of this species are known.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species inhabits pools forming schools on creeks and rivers of the Yungas, generally in clear water habitats with moderate water flow.", "threats": "This species has an important portion of its distribution range in agricultural areas and areas under deforestation and habitat modification. It is also under threat from water sewage from local populations, industries and agrochemicals. Additionally, it can be used occasionally as bait or consumed as food by the local human populations.", "conservationmeasures": "No specific conservation actions are taken towards this species, although it is probably present in some protected areas within its distributional range.", "usetrade": "This species can be used occasionally as bait or consumed as food by the local human populations."}]}
