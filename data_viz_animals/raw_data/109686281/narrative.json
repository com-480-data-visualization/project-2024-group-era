It is also very vulnerable to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) through the Malili lakes system. This species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered based on its extremely limited distribution and deterioration of habitats.", "geographicrange": "<p>The species&#160;is endemic to Lake Mahalona (24.4 km<sup>2</sup>), which is part of the Malili Lakes system, Sulawesi, Indonesia.</p>", "population": "<p>The current population trend is unknown, however an overall population decline of at least 50% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder e<em>t al</em>. 2012) and are thought to have caused the decline of <em>Tylomelania </em>populations through predation of small adults and juveniles (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) where they are predicted to cause population declines similar to those seen in Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This is a rock-dwelling freshwater lake species.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system.
