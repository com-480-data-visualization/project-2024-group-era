An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it likely to be small and with the available data is certainly below 500 km\u00b2 and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in northern Luzon. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is also small (EOO is less than 5,000 km\u00b2).

The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest in northern Luzon.
