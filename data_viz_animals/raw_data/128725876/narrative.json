A high elevation species, the species is threatened by a range of stressors including increasing spells of drought, pollution and hydropower dams. There is also a threat to the habitats from disturbances as a result of military presence and conflicts. Being a single location species, these threats either individually or in synergy can push the species towards extinction if steps are not taken to protect the critical habitats.
