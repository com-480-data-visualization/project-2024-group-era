{"name": "109723823", "result": [{"species_id": 109723823, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>The species is widely distributed in Lake Mahalona and occurs at one site in Lake Towuti, both in Sulawesi, where it is only found on soft substrate. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 70 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 32 km<sup>2</sup>. This is counted as a single location with major threats including pollution from nickel mining, eutrophication and predation from invasive species, most critically Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.). It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered given its extremely limited distribution, deterioration of its habitat and the future impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lakes Mahalona and Towuti.<br/> </p>", "geographicrange": "The species&#160;is widely distributed in Lake Mahalona (24.4 km<sup>2</sup>) and known from two localities in Lake Towuti (561.1 km<sup>2</sup>), which are both part of the Malili Lakes system in Sulawesi, Indonesia.", "population": "<p>There is no current population information available for this species although it was previously reported as abundant in Lake Mahalona (von Rintelen <em>et al.</em> 2007). The current population trend is unknown, but an overall population decline of at least 50% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder<em> et al.</em> 2012) and are thought to have caused the decline of <em>Tylomelania</em> populations through predation of small adults and juveniles (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti where they are predicted to cause population declines similar to those seen in Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in freshwater lakes on soft substrates such as sand and mud.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic.<br/><br/>Many species of <em>Tylomelania</em> are being collected for the aquarium pet trade.&#160;<em>Tylomelania</em><em>&#160;wolterecki </em>does not seem to be traded yet, though, and is unlikely to become a major target.<br/><br/>Finally, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids, <em>Colossoma</em> sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and have unknown but potentially serious consequences through predation of small adults and juveniles (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012), as recent surveys in Lake Matano have found only large individuals of large <em>Tylomelania </em>species remaining (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). They have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of at least 50% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>No conservation plans are currently in place for this species,&#160;but protection of its known localities and habitats is needed, along with invasive species control. Research is also needed into the population dynamics, ecology and the threats to this species.</p>", "usetrade": "Many species of&#160;<em>Tylomelania</em>&#160;of the Malili lakes are collected and traded as aquarium pets or eaten locally, but there is no use or trade information available for this species."}]}
