An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. The AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of lowland forest in Palawan. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is significantly less than 20,000 km\u00b2 but is probably greater than 5,000 km\u00b2. The overall population is inferred to be declining and likely to be severely fragmented. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and, taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, is assessed as such.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Coeliccia palawana</em> is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R. M\u00fcller identified by M. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Muller 1997, Lieftinck 1940, Villanueva <em>et al</em>. 2018). The assessor is aware of records from at least 11 locations but it has not been possible to assign coordinates to three of these for mapping purposes. The species is present in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area which may receive totally protected status and is likely to be present in the Mount Mantalingajan Protected Landscape and Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park. It is certainly present in the Victoria and Anepahan Ranges in the centre of Palawan, these are not protected but are an Important Bird Area (IBA). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of lowland forest in Palawan. The area of Palawan is approximately 12,189 km\u00b2, therefore the extent of occurrence (EOO) for this species is significantly less than 20,000 km\u00b2. Its EOO based only on the eight mapped data points is 4,880 km\u00b2, but this is an underestimate and the EOO is more likely to be greater than 5,000 km\u00b2. Its EOO based on known occupied HydroBASIN areas is 10,577 km\u00b2<br/></p>", "population": "<p>There is insufficient information on this species to make any statement about populations except that an ongoing decline will likely be taking place due to loss and degradation of forest on Palawan and that severe fragmentation is very likely.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Very little has been recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it occurs at forest streams. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation resulting from agriculture and logging. BirdLife International (2019a, but based on information from 2001) note (for Palawan in general) that \u201cSmall-scale timber extraction and well-organised logging operations are hastening the depletion of the forest cover on the island\u201d, this is despite the fact that the entire island is a Biosphere reserve. The same source also notes extensive clearance of forest on and south of Mount Mantalingajan, apparently for shifting and permanent agriculture; satellite images present the same picture. For the Victoria and Anepahan Ranges IBA BirdLife International (2019b, but based on information from 2001) state \u201cThe most serious threats to the forests here are illegal logging and kaingin [slash and burn agriculture]. Emigration from other parts of the Philippines to Palawan is high and squatting is commonplace. There are existing concessions for Almaciga resin and rattan gathering, which are often not exploited in a sustainable way. It was reported in early 1999 that a typhoon has caused extensive damage to the forests at Iwahig, destroying the crowns of many trees and hence opening up the canopy, and presumably elsewhere on Palawan. The logging in this IBA in the past also contributed to the extensive forest damage.\u201d</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more information on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Total protection of additional areas in Palawan where the species occurs (for instance Cleopatra\u2019s Needle) is highly desirable.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
