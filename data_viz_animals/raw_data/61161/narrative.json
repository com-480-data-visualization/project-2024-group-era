{"name": "61161", "result": [{"species_id": 61161, "taxonomicnotes": "This species previously appeared on the IUCN Red List as&#160;<em>Pseudotropheus ater</em> Stauffer, 1988 but is now valid in the genus <em>Chindongo&#160;</em>Li, Konings &amp; Stauffer, 2016.", "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it is only known from two islands.&#160;It meets the area requirements under criterion B for Critically Endangered and it is known from two locations based on the threat of pollution. However, the threats recognised are thought unlikely to push the species to Critically Endangered or Extinct within a short time period, meaning it does not currently meet the thresholds for Vulnerable D2. At present, there is no evidence of a continuing decline in the habitat quality or the number of mature individuals. This species is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi, where it occurs at Chinyankwazi and Chinyamwezi islands.", "population": "No information is available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is found in rocky habitats inhabiting caves in a sediment free environment at depths of between 3-15 m. It feeds on loose aufwuchs from the rock surface, as well as on plankton. Territorial males are observed throughout the year. Females have also been observed defending feeding territories. Spawning occurs inside the male's cave. The maximum size is 11 cm total length.", "threats": "Pollution of water around the two small islands to which this species is restricted resulting from the waste of illegal fishermen that have settled on Chinyankwazi Island is a threat to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is only found in Lake Malawi National Park.", "usetrade": "This species is not targeted by the ornamental fish trade."}]}
