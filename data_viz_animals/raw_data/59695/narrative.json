The recent one is in the Kundelungu National Park. The EOO is rather large, but includes the old records, of which we do not know, whether the species is still existing there (21,800 km\u00b2). The Area of Occupancy is 20 km\u00b2. Since forest destruction is an increasing environmental problem in Africa, there is an ongoing threat to the species, even though we do not know much about its ecology. It is listed Endangered, based on the small AOO, only 3 locations and ongoing habitat destruction.", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from south the Democratic Republic of Congo (Katanga Province, Mitwaba Escarpment) and Libuli (possibly within the protected area of Upemba). Its area of occupancy is 20 km\u00b2, and it is probably constrained to higher altitudes.", "population": "Current population size is unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Forest streams and rivers.", "threats": "Deforestation caused by wood extraction is the main threat to the taxon.", "conservationmeasures": "Protection of forest areas is required.", "usetrade": null}]}
