Future development to support an expanding number of annual tourists is expected to have considerable consequences on coastal freshwater ecosystems (Torres&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Anecdotal reports of declining freshwater fish abundance and localized extirpation of some species in the Yuna River suggest that the impacts of damming structures on the Blanco River have altered sedimentation patterns and natural hydrology considerably (Berge&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). </p>  <p>Cultivated land (primarily used for coffee production) covers approximately 43% of the Haina River basin, resulting in considerable sedimentation and soil erosion (Izzo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).

Coastal and alluvial plains in this region support a high concentration of anthropogenic activities (e.g., mechanized agriculture, industrial production), and downstream catchments in the Haina River drainage are severely contaminated with agricultural, industrial, and urban pollutants (Izzo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).</p>  <p>The non-native poeciliids <em>Poecilia reticulata</em> and <em>Xiphophorus hellerii </em>have established populations in several Dominican drainages, and may compete with native poeciliids for resources (Rodr\u00edguez Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p>  <p>Despite uncertainties regarding the scope, magnitude, and direct impact of these threats on <em>R. roloffi</em>, continuing decline with regarding to habitat quality is inferred. </p><br/><p></p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>R. roloffi</em>.
