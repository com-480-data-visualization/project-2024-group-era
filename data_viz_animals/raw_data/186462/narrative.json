However, the species has been registered in new localities in Brazil, although further information on exact occurrences needs to be investigated, whilst its exact range in Argentina also requires a deeper look. The species' habitat is&#160;moderately threatened by ongoing habitat loss attributed to the construction of dams and destruction of lotic habitats. As such, based on the lower bounds of the extent of occurrence (EOO; 17,200-45,700 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (AOO; 20-4,940 km<sup>2</sup>) meeting the required thresholds, as well as an inferred continuing decline on habitat quality, the species is precautionarily assessed as Near Threatened under&#160;B1b(iii)+2b(iii). Further research and investigation into the species range may however lead to a status change in the future.&#160;<span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span class=\"tlid-translation translation\" lang=\"en\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><span title=\"\" class=\"\"><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in South America, in the Paran\u00e1 River basin in Argentina and Brazil (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2020).
