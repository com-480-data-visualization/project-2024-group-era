The collection locality within the Formoso River is located within Das Emas National Park, where habitat degradation is mitigated (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020).&#160;</p>  <p>Area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 8 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a 2x2 km grid overlain on the two known collection locality of this species (Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 8-10,690 km<sup>2</sup>, with a lower estimate that is equivalent to the estimated AOO based on available georeferenced collection records (Silva et al. 2018), and an upper estimate calculated by generating a minimum convex polygon around the Correntes River sub-basin.&#160;The Correntes River is directly impacted by deforestation and regional land-use changes associated with industrial scale agricultural production and cattle ranching (Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Filoso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Spera&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). However, the collection locality within the Formoso River is contained within Das Emas National Park where threats are largely mitigated. Therefore, this species is assigned to two threat-based locations. Future ichthyological sampling in the region may yield additional collection localities.</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown. </p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>This species is known only from the Corrente and Formoso rivers in the upper Paran\u00e1 River basin in the Brazilian Cerrado (Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Collection sites are characterized by marginal vegetation and quickly moving water (Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Reproductively mature males are sexually dimorphic based on the presence of a urogenital papilla, a pelvic fin that extends beyond the anal fin origin, and unbranched pelvic fin ray that supports a dermal flap along its dorsal surface (Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p>", "threats": "<p>The primary threat to aquatic ecosystem integrity in southwestern Goi\u00e1s State is severe land-use alteration associated with agricultural expansion and cattle ranching which dominate the landscape (Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Costa 2012, Filoso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Spera&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Beginning with the relocation of Brazil\u2019s capital to Bras\u00edlia in 1960, the Cerrado frontier was subjected to rapid development of road networks and subsequent agricultural development (Latubesse&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Agricultural activities in this region are responsible for the majority of Brazilian agricultural production, including that of soybeans, maize, and more recently sugar cane to support ethanol production (Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Filoso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Spera&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Intensive pesticide and chemical fertilizer applications are regularly utilized in agricultural production methods (Alves&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Wittman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Between 39-55% of the original Cerrado land cover has been lost (Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). In Goi\u00e1s State, 69% of the watersheds larger than 500 km<sup>2</sup> have less than 50% of remnant vegetation (Latrubesse&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Diversion of surface water resources to support agricultural irrigation has the ability to quickly dewater annual and perennial streams (Costa 2012). </p>  <p>Despite uncertainties regarding the direct impact of existing threats on <em>C. lucianoi</em>, continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p></p><p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>C. lucianoi</em>. The Formoso River extends into Das Emas National Park where primary threats are largely mitigated (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020), but adjacent land is heavily impacted by agricultural activities and cattle ranching (Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Filoso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Spera&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Ichthyological surveys in nearby and hydrologically connected streams and rivers are urgently needed to clarify distribution, population size, and population status.
