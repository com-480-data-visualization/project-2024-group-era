It is not known if it occurs in any protected area. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible, but since it clearly has a very local occurrence, the AOO is inferred to be below 500 km\u00b2. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. The overall population is clearly severely fragmented and significant threats exist throughout the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 9,723\u201314,302 km\u00b2, which is within thecriterion B1 threshold for Vulnerable; however, since its AOO is likely to be smaller than 500 km\u00b2, this species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B2 (EN B2ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Pericnemis gili</em> is known only from three scattered locations in central and northern Luzon, the Philippines (Villanueva and Dow 2020).
