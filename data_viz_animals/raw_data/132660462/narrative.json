{"name": "132660462", "result": [{"species_id": 132660462, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species could be assessed as Vulnerable because it occurs in only one locality (Criterion D2), and probably has a naturally low population. However, the location is protected, there is no evidence of impact (although tourism always poses a risk), and there is the possibility for the species to retreat to inaccessible parts of the cave system if threatened in the more reachable parts of the stream. Jelks <em>et al.</em> (2008) and the Norma Oficial Mexicana&#160;assessed it as Threatened. Here, with a more conservative view, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "<em>Rhamdia macuspamemsis</em> is known only from the type locality, a stream in the caves of Agua Blanca, State of Tabasco, Mexico (Weber and Wilkens 1998).", "population": "There is no data available on population size or trend. The population is probably small, as is usual with troglobytic fishes.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The stream inside the limestone cave system has a rocky bottom. Water level fluctuates with the rains, but normally holds a slow flow, with temperature of 22 \u00b0C. This species eats molluscs and other invertebrates (Weber and Wilkens 1998).", "threats": "Although the only known locality is protected, tourism is allowed and could become a threat if accompanied by habitat modification (including lighting in the cave, trash, etc.).", "conservationmeasures": "The species is listed in the Norma Oficial Mexicana (also by Jelks<em> et al.&#160;</em>2008) and the type locality is a protected area.", "usetrade": "This species is not utilised."}]}
