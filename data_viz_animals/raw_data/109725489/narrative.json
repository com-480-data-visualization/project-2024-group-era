{"name": "109725489", "result": [{"species_id": 109725489, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>The species is endemic to Lake Towuti (561.1 km<sup>2</sup>) in Sulawesi, which is counted as a single location with major threats including pollution from nickel mining, eutrophication, and invasive species. The species is only found in the rocky substrate areas within Lake Towuti and is restricted to the north-west shores of the lake, with an extent of occurrence (EOO) and an area of occupancy (AOO) both of 4 km<sup>2</sup>, which makes it extremely vulnerable to the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma&#160;</em>sp.). The spread of invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids to Lake Towuti from Lake Mahalona is almost certain and is predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) and caused the rapid loss of&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia</em>&#160;populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered given its extremely limited distribution, expected deterioration of its habitat and the future impact of Flowernhorn Cichlids in Lake Towuti.</p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Sulawesidrobia soedjatmokoi</em><em> </em>is endemic to Lake Towuti in the Malili Lake system  (Sulawesi, Indonesia) and is only known from a single locality on the north-west shore of the lake (Zielske <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is possible that other sites may be found if a specific survey was done for suitable habitats along the shores and within rivers in the catchment, although its presence in rivers and springs around the lake is highly unlikely given its habitat specialisation (Zielske&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).", "population": "<p>The current population trend is unknown, however an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years due to the spread of the invasive Flowerhorn Cichlids (<em>Colossoma&#160;</em>sp.) in the Malili lakes (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). This prediction is based on the impact of Flowerhorn Cichlids in Lake Matano, where they spread throughout the entire lake in under 10 years (Herder&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) and caused the rapid loss of&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia&#160;</em>populations (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2017; 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and they are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines in this species similar to those seen in the&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia</em>&#160;populations of Lake Matano.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This is a rock-dwelling freshwater lake species.", "threats": "<p>Current threats to the species are pollution from nickel mining and water regulation due to hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to soil erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic. Most critically, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn cichlids,&#160;<em>Colossoma</em>&#160;sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and&#160;<em>Sulawesidrobia</em>&#160;species are an important part of their diet (Herder<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012). The apparent eutrophication in Lake Matano may also be partly due to the removal of most grazers of algae (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and, if not already present, are very likely to continue to spread downstream to Lake Towuti through River Tominanga, where they are predicted to cause a population decline of &gt;90% in this species within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are no known conservation actions currently in place for this species and research into potential threats and its distribution is recommended, as it is possibly more widespread than currently known. Monitoring for the expansion of the invasive species is urgently required to be determine potential threats. <br/></p>", "usetrade": "This species is not utilised."}]}
