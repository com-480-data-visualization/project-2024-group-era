{"name": "139069191", "result": [{"species_id": 139069191, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Cephalaeschna algorei</em> is known from only two specimens from a single mountainous and apparently non-protected location in Yen Bai Province, northern Viet Nam. Based on it only being known to occur in forest above 1,000 m asl, its area of occupancy (AOO) is likely to be smaller than 500 km\u00b2, possibly by a considerable margin. Its AOO is also inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to serious deforestation in the region where the species occurs. Taking a reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, the species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B2ab(ii,iii)). It is to be hoped that reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible when more data are available to clarify the range of this species, however reassessment to Critically Endangered is equally possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Cephalaeschna algorei</em> is known from one male and one female from a mountainous and apparently non-protected location in Yen Bai Province, northern Viet Nam, collected in 2014 and 2015 (Karube and Kompier 2017). The range of hills and mountains in which the species occurs extends into Yunnan Province in China, so the species should be looked for in Yunnan as well as in Viet Nam; serious threats are present over much of this area. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but given that it is only known to occur in forest above 1,000 m asl, unless it has a much wider distribution than is currently known its AOO is likely to be below 500 km\u00b2 and could very well be considerably less than this. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the area that the species is known from.", "population": "<p>All that can be said with the available information is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of forest in the area where the species occurs and if it is not confined to a single location (unlikely) then severe fragmentation is likely for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Karube and Kompier (2017: 70) state: \u201cfound hanging inside a thicket at about 3 meters height, where some water was flowing over the ground surface, although it was not a proper stream.\u201d It is almost certain that this is a forest-dependent stream-breeding species, and it is likely to be confined to altitudes above 1,000 m asl. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within the area in which it is known to occur.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation. Satellite images show that there is already severe deforestation across much of the range of hills and mountains where the only known location for the species is, especially in that area, and extending to high altitudes in many places. The motivations for this deforestation are not definitely known to the assessors but clearance for agriculture and/or livestock farming is presumably a major driver, as is illegal logging and clearance along streams for fish farms.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The first priorities for this species are for protection of habitat where it occurs and for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. It is not known if the species occurs in any protected area, but part of the same mountain range, considerably further north than the type locality of the species, is protected as Hoang Lien National Park. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
