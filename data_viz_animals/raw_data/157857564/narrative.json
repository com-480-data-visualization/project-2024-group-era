{"name": "157857564", "result": [{"species_id": 157857564, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine bivalve is restricted to hydrothermal vents at deep ocean ridges in the Atlantic Ocean. It is currently known from one restricted location, in the distinctive and restricted habitat of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at a depth of 3,038 m bsl, and would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if commercial deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. The potential for anthropogenic influence at this site based on exploration licences for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites supports a projected continuing decline in quality of habitat. There may already be disturbance to this species as ISA exploration-phase licences allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing. The impact of uncertainty around the decline in habitat means that the applicable threat level for this species ranges from VU to CR, using the recommended risk tolerance. We have opted to take a precautionary approach based on this level of uncertainty and presence at a single location and therefore assessed the species as the top of this range, Critically Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). <br/><br/>A reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea bivalve is restricted to one location at hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. This location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, and with biologically and geologically coherent identity. Any vent fields within this location therefore also have common exposure to relevant potential threats. This location lies beyond national jurisdiction in International Waters. The species is currently known from one vent field with active black smokers and diffuse venting located at a depth of 3,038 m bsl, namely the Logatchev-1 vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Oliver and Holmes 2006, Taylor and Glover 2010). This species is present over a small area at this vent field.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Oliver and Holmes 2006, Taylor and Glover 2010).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Atlantic Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at a depth of 3,038 m bsl.", "threats": "Several vent fields on the Mid-Atlantic ridges lie in seabed areas under licence for exploration for polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents (Van Dover <em>et al</em>. 2018). An exploration-phase licence for the region where the Logatchev-1 vent field is found was granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to the Government of the Russian Federation under a 15-year contract (2015-2030). The ISA exploration-phase licences allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing, hence there may already be disturbance of subpopulations. Both direct impacts from mineral extraction and indirect disturbance from adjacent activities could impact local subpopulations. Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al. </em>2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact of these activities is uncertain. These vent fields would be susceptible to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at the Logatchev-1 vent field. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
