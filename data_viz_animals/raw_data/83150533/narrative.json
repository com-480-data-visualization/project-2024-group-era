The populations are considered stable, but more studies on the trend and habitat utilisation are suggested. It has been assessed as Endangered because of its small extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), occurrence in a small number of locations, and ongoing pressure on water and wood resources.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Palau (Englund 2011).", "population": "The species has been reported in various studies (Lieftinck 1962, Katatani and Muraki 1997, Englund 2011).
