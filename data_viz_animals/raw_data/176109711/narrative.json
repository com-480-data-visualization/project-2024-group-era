It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) best estimated at 264 km\u00b2 and an area of occupancy (AOO) best estimated at 260 km\u00b2.

Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "Dolichancistrus cobrensis was described from Cobre River, tributary to the river La Grita, Catatumbo drainage in Maracaibo basin in Colombia and Venezuela (Schultz 1944). The species is present in southern tributaries of the Lago de Maracaibo (Catatumbo, Cobre, Escalante and Chama), and a few records also exist from the upper drainages of R\u00edo Apure, in tributaries of Uribante river: San Antonio, Quinimar\u00ed (Ballen and Vari 2012), and the river Arauca (R\u00edo Margua) in Colombia. The species is distributed in a range of elevations from 800 to 1,220 m above sea level.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 264 km\u00b2, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 260 km\u00b2). Given the threats to this species, it probably occurs in 1\u20132 threat-based locations.<br/><br/>The geographic attributes for <em>Dolichancistrus cobrensis </em>in this assessment were compiled, arranged and reviewed from the following sources: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2020), FishNet2 (Fishnet2 2020), FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2019), SiB Colombia (SiB Colombia 2020) and SpeciesLink (SpeciesLink 2020), and complemented with records from the databases of the following ichthyological collections from Colombia: CZUT-IC (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica, Universidad del Tolima, Ibagu\u00e9), IAvH-P (Colecci\u00f3n de Peces de Agua Dulce del Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n de Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos Alexander von Humboldt, Villa de Leyva), ICN-MHN (Instituto de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1), IMCN (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica de Referencia Cient\u00edfica del Museo de Ciencias Naturales Federico Carlos Lehmann Valencia del INCIVA, Cali), and MPUJ (Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural \"Lorenzo Uribe, S.J.\" de la Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot\u00e1), and MCNG (Museo de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Nacional Experimental de los Llanos Occidentales Ezequiel Zamora, Guanare, Venezuela) and CPUCLA (Colecci\u00f3n Regional de Peces, Museo de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado, Barquisimeto, Venezuela).", "population": "The current population trend is unknown, but it is probably decreasing due to the impacts of climate change and human stressors.&#160;It is a species with a very restricted distribution in the Andean mountains and is not common in collections.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "Schultz (1944) reported that <em>Dolichancistrus cobrensis&#160;</em>was collected in very swiftly running water among rubble to gravel. These environments are usual in the Andean mountains, with crystal clear and highly oxygenated waters. The species can reach up to 92.1 mm of standard length.", "threats": "The habitat of <em>Dolichancistrus cobrensis&#160;</em>is degraded by various stressors. Deforestation associated with agriculture is common, mainly associated with coffee and vegetable crops (Oliveira-Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rinc\u00f3n 2017) and is accompanied by rural roads that fragment rivers. In the region, there are several urban centres that generate untreated effluents. The change in land use within these basins is associated with the forecasts of climate change for the Tropical Andes region (e.g. M\u00e9ndez <em>et al.</em> 2017), with the alteration of hydrology and sediment transport, with adverse consequences for the survival of the species.", "conservationmeasures": "<em>Dolichancistrus cobrensis</em>&#160;is not subject to laws or regulations oriented for its specific protection. The species is reported in National Park Juan Pablo Pe\u00f1aloza (Venezuela) and probably in National Park El Tam\u00e1 and National Natural Park Tam\u00e1 in Venezuela and Colombia, respectively (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020). Habitat protection in the most impacted drainages, as well as awareness and communications, are recommended. It is necessary to research the actual conditions and trends for the population size and distribution, threats and habitat.", "usetrade": "There are no known uses for the species"}]}
