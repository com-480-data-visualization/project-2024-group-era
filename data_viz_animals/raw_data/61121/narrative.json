Ribbink <em>et al. </em>(1983) report that it feeds on scales, which has sometimes been observed in an aquarium. Also in the aquarium it only attacks non-mbuna and completely ignore mbuna. Konings (1995) also observed small groups feeding on eggs and larvae of the catfish <em>Bagrus meridionalis</em>. Stomach inventories of six specimens collected at Makanjila Point revealed that it is a predator, feeding on catfish eggs, larvae and also on scales of other fishes, in particular those that are stuck in a net. An exclusive scale-feeding habitat has not become apparent from observations in the wild. Usually only one male in breeding colouration is seen in a group of foraging individuals and territoriality has not been observed, also not in the aquarium.", "threats": "Collection for the aquarium trade is the major threat.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are in place for this species.", "usetrade": "In the past this species was collected by the ornamental fish trade but it may have vanished from these collecting grounds; of little importance for subsistence fishermen."}]}
