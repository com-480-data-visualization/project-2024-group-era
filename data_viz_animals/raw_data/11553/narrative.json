There is one location. The quality of the habitat is declining due to mining activities, grazing by livestock, and inappropriate fire regimes. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Critically Endangered under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Mpumalanga Province in South Africa, on the hills to the north-east of Barberton.", "population": "There is no information currently available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is restricted to rocky, hilly grassland (Barberton Montane Grassland).", "threats": "Notwithstanding the fact that the area of occupancy of the butterfly has been registered as a private nature reserve, there is ongoing legal and illegal mining in the reserve and its surrounds. There has been a gradual spread of alien vegetation, especially eucalypts and wattles, since the late 1960s and no attempts have been made to control or remove the alien species. Communal livestock, including cattle, donkeys and goats from surrounding rural communities have free access to the taxon's habitat. Increasing numbers of these animals may have a negative impact on the habitat. Fire regimes are also unregulated and members of the rural communities can set fire to the habitats inappropriately in attempts to induce growth of green grass for their livestock.", "conservationmeasures": "A management plan that includes appropriate habitat protection and management should be developed and implemented as soon as possible.", "usetrade": null}]}
