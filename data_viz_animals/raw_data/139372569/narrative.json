Even counting the location in Kelantan, at most three locations have been recorded for the species. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) cannot be made with the available data, but it may be small; currently available data indicate that AOO is less than 2,000 km\u00b2 (it is likely to be considerably less than this). The AOO, extent and quality of suitable habitat are all inferred to be declining from severe loss of forest in the Cameron Highlands. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and D2. Hopefully when more information is available on the distribution of the species it may be possible to reassess it into a lower threat category, however, given the likely very small AOO for this species, reassessment to Endangered or Critically Endangered seems likely.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Stylogomphus malayanus</em> is only known from Peninsular Malaysia, where it is known from one location in Perak (Sasamoto 2001, 2004); a location less than 30 km away in the Cameron Highlands District of Pahang (Ng <em>et al. </em>2011); and a record that may or may not refer to this species, from Gunung Stong in Kelantan (Choong <em>et al. </em>2017).
