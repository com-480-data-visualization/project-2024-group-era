{"name": "145380484", "result": [{"species_id": 145380484, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents on mid-oceanic ridges in the Indian Ocean. It is currently known from two restricted locations in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 2422 m to 2606&#160;m bsl. The impact of uncertainty around the total AOO, EOO and other biological factors mean that the applicable threat level for this species ranges from VU to EN, using the recommended risk tolerance.&#160;We have opted to take a precautionary approach based on this level of uncertainty and therefore assessed the species as EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted AOO, and has been found at two locations, the threat of current and future anthropogenic influence in these sites based on exploration licenses for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites would drive this species to CR very rapidly.&#160;There may already be disturbance to this species as ISA exploration-phase licenses allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing, thus justifying an inferred and projected continuing decline in the extent and quality of the habitat.<em>&#160;</em>A reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining license arrangements or if there are future changes to the prices of relevant commodities.</p>", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to two locations at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Indian Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.<br/><br/>Location 1 lies in&#160;International Waters and&#160;is an exploration license contract area granted by the International Seabed Authority to the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany. Location 2 is the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mauritius. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of&#160;2422 m to 2606&#160;m bsl. It has been observed from two vent fields: at the Kairei vent field (in Location 1) and at the Solitaire vent field (in Location 2) (Okuntani<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2004, Watanabe and Beedessee 2015). This species is present over a small area - the combined total area of the Kairei and Solitaire vent fields is 0.057 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Hashimoto <em>et al</em>. 2001, Nakamura <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the distance between the two vent fields is 772.98 km.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles and a human-occupied vehicle, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Okutani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges in the Indian Ocean. It is currently known from the active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2422 m to 2606 m&#160;bsl.&#160;<br/><br/>Geological context \u2013 the Central Indian Ridge is an intermediate to slow spreading ridge. Environmental Impact Assessments based on the dynamics of the East Pacific or other fast-spreading ridges cannot be applied to this different geological context.<p></p>", "threats": "The Kairei Vent Field lies in a seabed area licensed for the exploration of exploitation of polymetallic sulfide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents. The exploration-phase license for the Kairei Vent&#160;Field was granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) for a 15-year contract (2015-2030) to the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany. The ISA exploration-phase licenses allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing, hence there may already be disturbance of the subpopulation. Evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al. </em>2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.&#160;One locality (Solitaire) lies within the Mauritius Exclusive Economic Zone.&#160;As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain. This vent field may be susceptible to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at any Indian Ocean vent fields, however, further research is recommended to determine whether the populations would be susceptible to disturbance by mining, to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the Central and Southern Indian ridges and to ascertain the dispersal capability for this species, as these will assist in re-evaluation of the conservation status of the species. Development of protocols to minimise sediment plume creation by those investigating the sea-bed habitats during exploration for mineral would be beneficial for all species in these sensitive habitats.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
