An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the area of Dumaran is less than 800 km\u00b2 and not all habitat will be suitable for this species, therefore the AOO can be safely assumed to be less than 500 km\u00b2. If it is genuinely confined to Dumaran then the true AOO of the species will be considerably less than this since it is evident from satellite images that considerable deforestation has occurred on the island, leaving only scattered patches of original forest. The AOO is inferred to be declining since there is no reason to suppose that the deforestation is not ongoing. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is constrained by that of Dumaran and is therefore less than 800 km\u00b2.</p>", "population": "<p>All that can be said about current population sizes for this species is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from the deforestation occurring on Dumaran and that if the species is not already confined to a single threat defined location (taking deforestation as the main threat) then the population will already be severely fragmented.All that can be said about current population sizes for this species is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from the deforestation occurring on Dumaran and that if the species is not already confined to a single threat defined location (taking deforestation as the main threat) then the population will already be severely fragmented.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Nothing was recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it will be forest-dependent.
