{"name": "118043564", "result": [{"species_id": 118043564, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species has a restricted distribution. The area of distribution of this species has been highly disturbed and faces intense pressure from agricultural use, the construction of dams and urban development. There are two threat-based locations based on these impacts. Both the extent of occurrence (EOO: 1,826 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (AOO: 24 km<sup>2</sup>) are small. The habitat quality and distribution of this species are declining. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in the central Venezuelan Andes, in the rivers Santo Domingo, Bocon\u00f3, La Yuca and Mazparro, that drain towards Apure River, Orinoco drainage.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate a population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It inhabits foothills streams characterized by their substrate of cobbles and the presence of riffles and pools (DoNascimiento and Milani 2008).", "threats": "This species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation due to urban development, agricultural plantations and cattle farms, and because of the presence of dams.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is not known from any protected areas, but clearly there is a need for improved habitat protection at sites where it is known to occur. Further survey work is required to determine whether or not this species is experiencing a genuine decline, or is undergoing natural population fluctuations. This species would benefit from habitat restoration and better information on distribution, abundance, population trend, and threats.", "usetrade": "It is unknown whether this species is traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
