A population decline of 25% is suspected over the past 10 years. This species is evaluated as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "<p>The type locality is the Essequibo River, Guyana. It is present in the Essequibo and Demerara River Basins. It is also present in the Cuyuni River, an Essequibo tributary, in eastern Venezuela. It is possibly also present in the Corantijn River basin in Guyana and Suriname, and the upper Branco River drainage (Amazon Basin) of southern Guyana and northern Brazil. Records from southern and western Amazon are considered misidentifications.</p>", "population": "There are no data available to estimate the population size of this species.

It migrates during the rainy season (Planquette <em>et al</em>. 1996). It feeds almost exclusively on Podostemaceae plants that grow in the rapids.", "threats": "This species is susceptible to overfishing, and also to habitat loss and deterioration.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no specific conservation measures to protect this species.
