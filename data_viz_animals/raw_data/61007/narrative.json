{"name": "61007", "result": [{"species_id": 61007, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Endemic to Lake Malawi where it is only known from two restricted locations. Thick-lipped cichlids always occur in rocky habitats and an increasing sedimentation may completely cover the rocks in very deep water. With only two locations and the threats of sedimentation and localised over-fishing, this species is listed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "Endemic to Lake Malawi where it is known from two localities, Ngara (in the north) and southeast of Mbenji Island, near Domira Bay (central part of the lake). Although the distribution and abundance of <em>O. pachycheilus</em> in the central and northern parts of Lake Malawi is unknown (due to inadequate sampling), it appears to be an uncommon species of little commercial importance in areas where it has been collected. Because it is a very distinctive species, and the fact that it has not been recorded from the relatively shallow southern arms of the lake where most of the mechanized trawling activities and taxonomic efforts have been directed, it is thought to be rare or absent in these regions.", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is a deep-water demersal species, occurring over a hard bottom substrates containing loose cobbles and coarse sand, recorded at depths of 78\u2013135 m. It is known to mainly feed on invertebrates.", "threats": "Localised over-fishing and sedimentation are potential threats to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "No information available.", "usetrade": "This species has never been collected for the aquarium trade, but it is most likely eaten when captured in the fishery."}]}
