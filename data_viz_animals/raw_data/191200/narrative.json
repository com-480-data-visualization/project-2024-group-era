T<span class=\"st\">he localities in Campeche and Quintana Roo identified by Schmitter-Soto (1998), and by Miller <em>et al</em>.

This species has been collected in 25 sites from the coastal zone of the State of Yucatan in karstic ponds, petenes, and wetlands with freshwater and brackish conditions (Vega-Cendejas <em>et al</em>. in preparation), but according to current threats (urban development north of M\u00e9rida, saltworks west of R\u00eda Lagartos), these sites probably represent four or five locations (Schmitter-Soto 2017).
