Twenty one locations have been recorded for the species, including within protected areas (for instance Gunong Mulu, Lambir Hills and Similajau National Parks in Sarawak). Almost all locations are within Brunei or adjacent parts of Sarawak, with just one seemingly isolated location (Similajau National Park) further to the southwest. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining to some degree, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, due to loss and degradation of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 10,513 km\u00b2. Although the species is still relatively common and is present in a number of protected areas, its populations are becoming increasingly fragmented (although probably not severely fragmented yet) and its EOO is plausibly well below the 20,000 km\u00b2 threshold for Vulnerable under criterion B1. However, since the number of locations is &gt;10, the species is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B1ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Coeliccia roberti</em> is endemic to Borneo where it is known from Brunei and Sarawak (Dow 2020).

To this it can be added that the species is known from disturbed forest at some locations but has not been found in highly degraded forest or in plantation habitats. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>Outside of protected areas populations in Sarawak are threatened by conversion of forest to plantation or for other agriculture. Within Brunei the situation is currently better but in the longer term many populations are likely to be threatened by conversion of forest to agricultural land.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priority for this species is for more information on its distribution, particularly in Sarawak, and on its ability to tolerate disturbance. The species would certainly benefit from good conservation practices in plantations, such as leaving wide buffers of original forest around streams and the setting up of conservation areas consisting of original forest and including stream heads, and the strict enforcement of existing regulations for plantations and for logging activities.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
