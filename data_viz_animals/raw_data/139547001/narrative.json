An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. The AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of lowland forest in Palawan. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by that of Palawan and Busuanga and is therefore less than 20,000 km\u00b2. Overall, the population is inferred to be declining and is likely to be severely fragmented. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and, taking the precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, is assessed as such.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cyclophaea cyanifrons</em> is endemic to the Philippines where it is known from Palawan (Asahina 1968, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.

The assessor is aware of records from 20 locations but it has not been possible to assign coordinates to two of these for mapping purposes. The species occurs in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area which may gain totally protected status and is present in the Mount Mantalingajan Protected Landscape and likely to occur in the&#160;Puerto Princesa&#160;Subterranean River National Park. It is certainly also present in the Victoria and Anepahan Ranges in the centre of Palawan, these are not protected but are an Important Bird Area (IBA). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species.&#160;The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by the area of the islands on which it has been found and is therefore less than 20,000 km\u00b2 (EOO is calculated 16,337 km\u00b2 based on a minimum convex polygon around the mapped daa points).</p>", "population": "<p>Judging from the number of specimens in the M\u00fcller collection, this species can be common where it occurs. Beyond this all that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of lowland forest in Palawan and its satellite Islands and that severe fragmentation is likely for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Virtually nothing has been recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it will be a species of lowland forest, confined to stream habitats. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation resulting from agriculture and logging. BirdLife International (2019a, but based on information from 2001) note (for Palawan in general) that \u201cSmall-scale timber extraction and well-organised logging operations are hastening the depletion of the forest cover on the island\u201d, this is despite the fact that the entire island is a Biosphere reserve. The same source also notes extensive clearance of forest on and south of Mount Mantalingajan, apparently for shifting and permanent agriculture; satellite images present the same picture. For the Victoria and Anepahan Ranges IBA BirdLife International (2019b, but based on information from 2001) state \u201cThe most serious threats to the forests here are illegal logging and kaingin [slash and burn agriculture]. Emigration from other parts of the Philippines to Palawan is high and squatting is commonplace. There are existing concessions for Almaciga resin and rattan gathering, which are often not exploited in a sustainable way. It was reported in early 1999 that a typhoon has caused extensive damage to the forests at Iwahig, destroying the crowns of many trees and hence opening up the canopy, and presumably elsewhere on Palawan. The logging in this IBA in the past also contributed to the extensive forest damage.\u201d Very serious deforestation is evident in satellite images of Busuanga.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more information on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Total protection of additional areas in Palawan where the species occurs (for instance Cleopatra\u2019s Needle) and any remaining habitat on Busuanga is highly desirable.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
