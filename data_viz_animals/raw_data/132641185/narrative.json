There is no current population data, but the number of specimens available in the sole collection used for the description suggests it is, or was, abundant (Schmitter-Soto 2017). The species is assessed as Vulnerable D2. Further information on the species population size, threats and trends may, however, reveal it to qualify under a higher threatened category.", "geographicrange": "<em>Astyanax tehuacanensis </em>is endemic to the R\u00edo Salado or Zapotitl\u00e1n (R\u00edo Papaloapan basin, Gulf of Mexico slope), south of Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla, central Mexico (Schmitter-Soto 2017). It is a highland, Neotropical species.", "population": "The is no current population data, but the number of specimens available in the sole collection used for the description suggests it is, or was, abundant (Schmitter-Soto 2017).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Rio Salado (also known as R\u00edo Zapotitl\u00e1n) means \"salty river\". No limnological data is available, but the chemistry of the water must be peculiar, and concentration of solutes must be high. The river varies between 40 cm and 2 m in depth. The current is usually swift, although the river may lose flow in the dry season given the aridity of the region; however, riparian vegetation is usually well developed. The river bottom is mostly rocky-sandy.", "threats": "The aridity of the region makes water extraction a potential threat. The presence of cities accounts for possible pollution by sewage; there are also industries and irrigated agricultural fields, which could contribute other pollutants (Montoya Ayala <em>et al. </em>2004). Finally, more intense droughts because of global change might endanger the permanence of the river.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no current conservation actions known. Segments of the river may run through a the Biosphere Reserve Tehuac\u00e1n-Cuicatl\u00e1n (Montoya Ayala <em>et al.</em> 2004), but the presence of the species in them is not certain.", "usetrade": "The species is not utilized."}]}
