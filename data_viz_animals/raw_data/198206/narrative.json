It is now considered to be extinct in Lake Matano due to the impact of invasive Flowerhorn Ciclihds (<em>Colossoma&#160;</em>sp.) after surveys in 2017 and 2018 failed to it (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). As Flowerhorn Cichlids have had a direct impact on this species in Lake Matano, and their presence in the Petea River and spread to the Tominanga and Lake Towuti is almost certain, they are predicted to cause a population decline in this species of &gt;90% within the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). As such this species is considered Critically Endangered under A3e.</p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Caridina parvula</em> is endemic to the Malili lake system and has been recorded as widely distributed in Lakes Matano and Towuti, with a few specimens found in the Petea and Tominanga rivers but none in Lake Mahalona (von Rintelen and Cai 2009). However, this species is now considered Possibly Extinct in Lake Matano given no specimens were recorded in the lake during surveys in 2017 and 2018&#160;(T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018).", "population": "<p>No specimens of this species were found in 2017 or 2018 in Lake Matano (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018), and it is now considered to be possibly extinct in this lake. This decline was likely due to the impact of invasive Flowerhorn Chiclids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) as <em>Caridina </em>species are an important part of their diet (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012). Based on this and the spread of Flowerhorn Cichlids in the Malili lakes, an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). They have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines similar to those seen in Lake Matano populations.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species lives primarily under rocks in shallow water, often in sympatry with other rock dwelling shrimps.", "threats": "<p>  </p><p>                     </p><p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic. This species is occasionally available in the aquarium trade. Most critically, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids, <em>Colossoma </em>sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and <em>Caridina </em>species are an important part of their diet (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012). In addition to their direct impact in Lake Matano, where this species is thought to be extinct, Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018). They are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona.

While some algal cover was observed before, this seems to have spread dramatically also to sites where none was observed before on rocks and roots in particular (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). Whether this apparent eutrophication is linked to the eradication of native shrimps by Flowerhorn Cichlids or to water level regulation by the mining company PT Vale remains to be investigated.", "conservationmeasures": "<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">No conservation plans are currently in place for this species,&#160;but protection and management of its known localities and habitats is needed, along with harvest management.&#160;Research is also needed into the population dynamics, ecology and the threats to this species.
