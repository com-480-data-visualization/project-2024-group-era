An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this forest stream species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. On the other hand, it is not known how tolerant the species is to disturbance, and it may well exhibit behaviour that makes it difficult to find and therefore be under-recorded. Threats from deforestation and possibly large scale hydroelectric projects certainly exist in central Laos, but it is difficult to assess how severe these threats are with the currently available data. However, it does not seem likely that this species will ever qualify for a Least Concern assessment and therefore Data Deficient may not be appropriate either. With only one known location and plausible threats that may result in the species becoming Criticaly Endangered or Extinct within a very short time, the species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criterion D2 and, taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, it is assessed as such.", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rhinocypha peitho</em> is known only from the holotype make collected at a location in central Laos in 2002 (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2017).
