{"name": "158297454", "result": [{"species_id": 158297454, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species is endemic to the central highlands of Kenya. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 402\u20131,980 km\u00b2 and its current known area of occupancy (AOO) is 16 km\u00b2. The species is found in two threat defined locations: Gatamaiyu and Nyambene Forests. The quality of the habitat for the species is in decline due to the spread of the invasive species, <em>Lantana camara </em>as well as the impacts of climate change. It is therefore&#160;assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)).", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to the central highlands of Kenya occurring in Gatamaiyu and Nyambene Forests. The type locality for the species is Gatamaiyu, Aberdare Mountains, South Kinangop (Larsen 1996).", "population": "The current population trend of this species not known. Fifty-two specimens from the African Butterfly Research Institute were collected between 1997 and 1998 from Gatamaiyu Forest.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species' habitat is highland forests that are in good condition according to Larsen (1996) and Williams (2019). It is a high flying species (Larsen 1996). The larval host plants for this species are unknown.", "threats": "The species is known from two subpopulations (Gatamaiyu and Nyambene), which are protected forest reserves. However, there is ongoing habitat degradation from the spread of invasive alien plant species in particular&#160;<em>Lantana camara.&#160;</em>The impacts of climate change are already being experienced through changes in rainfall patterns with extended dry seasons occurring throughout its range (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2011, GoK 2018).", "conservationmeasures": "Both known subpopulations occur within protected areas. Given that there are no records for this species for the past twenty years, there is a need to monitor the subpopulations to check how they are responding to habitat degradation from climate change and invasive alien species. Since its presence in Nyambene is only referred to in the literature, there is need to confirm its presence through the collection of specimens. The removal of the invasive species, <em>Lantana camara</em>&#160;which reduces the habitat quality of the forests where it occurs is the most important action required for the survival of this species.", "usetrade": "It is neither utilized nor traded."}]}
