Total population size and population trend are unknown. Additionally, limited ichthyological surveys suggest that this species is common at some localities where it occurs. A number of potential threats to aquatic habitat exist in Guatemala and El Salvador including deforestation associated with land-use changes, pollution from agricultural, urban, and industrial sources, mining activities, and hydropower development. While the direct impact of these threats on population status are unknown, they are producing continuous inferred declines in habitat quality and potentially availability. Due to the limited distribution of this species, the small number of locations in which it is inferred to occur, and inferred continuous declines in habitat quality, this species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion B1ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Profundulus guatemalensis</em> occurs on the Pacific slopes of Guatemala and El Salvador (Kine-Pineda <em>et al</em>. 2006, McMahan <em>et al</em>. 2013, W. Matamoros pers. comm. 2020). In El Salvador it is restricted to the extreme west of the country where it has been collected from the Carasucia San Pedro Drainage and the Paz River hydrographical zone (McMahan <em>et al</em>. 2013, E.

However, the range of this species includes at least one protected area, namely El Imposible National Park (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2019), which may confer indirect habitat protection.
