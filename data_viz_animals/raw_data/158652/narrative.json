{"name": "158652", "result": [{"species_id": 158652, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Isosticta spinipes</em> is endemic to New Caledonia where it is reported from the northern, central and southern parts of the main island of Grande Terre. It has a large extent of occurrence, but its area of occupancy is likely less than 500 km\u00b2. This species is less abundant and easily overlooked within larger populations of other <em>Isosticta</em> species. It is probably more common than currently known in the three sectors where it is mostly represented. It has an observed affinity towards forested streams and therefore may be threatened by deforestation. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to New Caledonia where it is distributed across the main island of Grande Terre (Grand <em>et al</em>. 2014). Ris (1915) reported it from Lifou Island, Loyalty Islands, however, this island has no rivers and most probably this observation was on an accidental individual. This record was cited in Kimmins (1958).", "population": "No information is available on population size or trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>The species occurs in forest creeks and small streams on slopes, but can also be present at lower altitudes. This species seems to tolerate ultramafic soils in the south of Grande Terre. Adults have always been observed in fully shaded parts of the streams.</p>", "threats": "There are no data available on threats to this species. It depends on forested streams and therefore deforestation may have an adverse effect on it.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures are known to be in place for this species.", "usetrade": null}]}
