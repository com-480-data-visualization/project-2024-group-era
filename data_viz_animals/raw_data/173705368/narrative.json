The assessors are aware of records from 14 separate sites, but some of these are so close to one another that they only constitute a single threat-defined location in the face of almost any imaginable threat, so that we only consider nine threat-defined locations to be known. Some locations are in protected areas. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of and disturbance to forest within the range of the species. Its known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 8,719\u201312,345 km\u00b2. The overall population will be severely fragmented and threats exist across the range of the species. The species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Euphaea sanguinea</em> is known from the east of Cambodia and south central Viet Nam (Kosterin 2016 as <em>Euphaea ochracea</em>, Phan <em>et al. </em>2018, Kompier unpub. data, Phan unpub. data). The assessors are aware of records from 14 separate sites but some of these are so close to one another that they only constitute a single threat-defined location in the face of almost any imaginable threat, therefore we only consider nine threat-defined locations to be known.
