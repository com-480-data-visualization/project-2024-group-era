None of the known locations appear to be within a protected area and threats exist at all locations. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data will be less than 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) calculated considerably less than 5,000 km\u00b2. This species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta leonardi</em> is known from the type series from two locations on Leyte in the Philippines and a probable record from Panaon (Villanueva <em>et al</em>. 2011).
