Three locations have been recorded for the species, including within the Nanling Nature Reserve in Guangdong. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but it is unlikely to be large (likely smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2). Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is &gt;44,000 km\u00b2. Despite its relatively large EOO, this is a locally occurring species with fragmented (possibly severely fragmented) populations and definite threats. With only three locations known, it is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It is to be hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Chlorogomphus auripennis</em> is only known from Fujian and Guangdong in China (Zhang 2019, unpublished, Zhang and Cai 2014).
