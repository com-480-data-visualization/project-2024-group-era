An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it will not be large and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest on the islands where it occurs. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by the area of the islands on which it occurs and will therefore not be very large, based on the currently available data it is likely to be less than 5,000 km\u00b2. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly. It is to be hoped that when more information becomes available reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible but given the levels of threat existing in the Philippines it is unlikely that this species will ever be assessed as Least Concern.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Igneocnemis nigra</em> is only known from five locations on Samar and Dinagat in the Philippines (Gassmann and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2002, Villanueva 2009). On Samar it is likely to be present in both the Mount Cabalantian - Mount Capoto-an complex and the Mount Yacgun - Mount Sohoton complex Important Bird Areas (IBA) and might be present in the Sohoton Natural Bridge Natural Park within the latter IBA. Additionally, the entirety of Samar is apparently a Natural Park but this does not seem to have any practical value. On Dinagat it is present in the Mount Kambinlio and Mount Redondo IBA but this has no genuine protected status. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it will not be large and is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest on the islands where it occurs.
