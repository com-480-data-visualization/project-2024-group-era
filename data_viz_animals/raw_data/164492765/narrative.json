However, based on the currently known records it has a relatively restricted distribution, with an extent of occurrence less than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>, an area of occupancy less than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>, and fewer than 10 locations. It is not clear whether threats are causing a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened, but further research on the species' distribution, population status, and threats is required.", "geographicrange": "The species is found in the Middle Paran\u00e1 River basin, including its main tributary, the Iguazu River, in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay (Pi\u00e1lek <em>et al</em>. 2019), however, the species' overall distribution remains highly uncertain as it could occur in a wider area within the Middle Paran\u00e1, although information on further collections are absent. Known records are additionally relatively sparse and the known range currently is relatively small.", "population": "Based on genetic analysis, there are known to be two lineages of this species with a biogeographically north\u2013south division (Pi\u00e1lek <em>et al</em>. 2019).
