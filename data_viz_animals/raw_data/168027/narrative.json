At least one location is within a protected area (the Chebaling National Nature Reserve in Guangdong). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible, but with the available data the AOO is not likely to be large (likely smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2). Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is &gt;43,000 km\u00b2. Although this is a relatively common species, there is certainly some cause for concern over its future. With only five locations currently known, it is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Chlorogomphus kitawakii</em> is only known from China, where there are records from five localities (Garrison <em>et al</em>. 2015, Karube 1995, Zhang 2019, unpublished, Zhang and Tong 2013).
