Even though the localion is situated in the Chimanimani National Park, the ongoing illegal goldmining in the entire mountain range including the National Park, poses an immediate threat to all aquatic organism in the area. There is an report from the giz on this issue (<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/giz2015-en-tfca-chimanimani.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/giz2015-en-tfca-chimanimani.pdf</a>) and the situation was reported as serious by local conservationists: \"The situation in the Chimanimanis is that there is considerable impact of alluvial goldmining along the upper streams and rivers, particularly on the Mozambique side of the mountains. The impact on the general ecosystem of the mountain habitats is limited and probably not lasting but certainly more serious to the those ecologies directly bound to the streams and stream banks such as your Odonata species\".(e-mail from Bart Wursten on 11th September 2016). Due to the unclear situation of the illegal gold mining in the mountainous regions in Zimbabwe, even within the National Parks, the Chimanimani Bluet is currently listed as Critically Endangered following the criteria B1ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "To date, this species has been recorded from only two sites in the Chimanimani Mountains, Zimbabwe. It may also occur in Mozambique, however more data are required to confirm this.", "population": "Current population size and trends are not known.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "A montane species (Pinhey 1969). Specific habitat details are unknown, even to Pinhey who described the species. However it is inferred to be a forest species based on the habitat in the collection area.", "threats": "There are illegal mining acitivities going on in the Chimanimani Mts, which is currently most likely the biggest threat for this species. Further potential threats to the species are deforestation, alien invasive trees, and alien invasive fish (e.g., trout). Deforestation is inferred to be a threat to the species, based on general deforestation occurring in the region. Since this is a montane species, the main threat may be fragmentation and, potentially, small populations.", "conservationmeasures": "Research into population numbers and range, biology and ecology, habitat status, threats, conservation measures, and trends/monitoring of this species would be valuable. Habitat and site-based actions are also required.", "usetrade": null}]}
