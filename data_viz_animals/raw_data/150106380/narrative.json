Population trend is suspected to be declining in at least a part of this species' range, but the rate of decline is unknown. Potential threats include pollution resulting from solid waste, non-native predators and parasites, and future reductions in the availability of water resources. However, the scope of these threats are unknown and the number of locations where this species occurs cannot be determined with accuracy.

Native distribution extends from the Indio River to the Cascajal River in Col\u00f3n (Lucena 2013, R. Gonz\u00e1lez pers. comm. 2019).

This species was historically dominant in Lake Gatun (Zaret and Paine 1973). Population trend is suspected to be in decline, based on recent samples taken from the Trinidad Arm of Lake Gatun where Sharpe <em>et al</em>. (2017) failed to detect this species.

This species prefers pool habitat with low water velocity. Reproduction occurs throughout the year, with more adults typically present during the dry season (R. Gonz\u00e1lez pers. comm. 2019).

Solid waste and raw sewage discharge from urban centres have the potential to negatively impact water quality (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez <em>et al</em>. 2002).
