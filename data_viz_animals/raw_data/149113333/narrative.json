Potential threats include the impacts of non-native species, mining activities and associated pollution, and regional deforestation, which have probably resulted in declines in the area, extent, and quality of habitat. However, there is no indication of major population decline. <em>Astyanax bransfordii</em> is assessed as Near Threatened because it exhibits a relatively restricted Extent of Occurrence (EOO), appears uncommon at several localities where it has been sampled, and habitat quality is likely affected by regional threats, but EOO does not meet the threshold for a threatened category under criterion B.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Astyanax bransfordii</em> is endemic to Lake Nicaragua and its tributaries on the Atlantic versant of Nicaragua and Costa Rica (Schmitter-Soto 2017). Angulo <em>et al</em>. (2018) report this species from the Frio, San Carlos, Sarapiqui, Tortuguero, and Parismina River basins. In Costa Rica, this species has been reported from about 23% of sampled localities within the Tirimbina Biological Reserve (Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2017), the Tirisias River (Espinoza Mendiola 2008) and the Sabogal River (Castillo-P\u00e9rez 2016).

In Lake Nicaragua, it is fairly abundant (Bussing 1998).

Mining activities may have considerable impacts on habitat quality at the localized scale (Espinoza Mendiola 2008, Helwege 2015). Non-native fishes have been introduced throughout much of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, including African Tilapia <em>Oreochromis mossambicus </em>(McKaye&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, McCrary <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Suckermouth Catfish <em>Hypostomus aspidolepis </em>and <em>H. niceforoi</em>&#160;(Castillo-P\u00e9rez 2016, A.
