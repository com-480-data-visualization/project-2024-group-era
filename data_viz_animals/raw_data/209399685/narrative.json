{"name": "209399685", "result": [{"species_id": 209399685, "taxonomicnotes": "Differences in morphological, ecological and behavioural traits suggest that the current five-species arrangement does not accurately reflect species diversity within&#160;<em>Kosciuscola&#160;</em>(Tatarnic&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Umbers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2021). Molecular work has identified species-level clades within&#160;<em>K. tristis</em><em>,&#160;</em>and provided strong evidence that&#160;<em>K. tristis&#160;</em>sensu stricto is restricted to the southern New South Wales mountains (Umbers<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2021), with the remaining clades within&#160;<em>K. tristis&#160;</em>representing undescribed species.<br/><br/>The recent emergence of major threats from climate change and bushfire, combined with the narrow ranges of these taxa as now understood, is potentially sufficient to justify assessing the reduced species concept of&#160;<em>K. tristis&#160;</em>pending formal publication of the forthcoming taxonomic revision, and to assess the undescribed congeners. However, before this is formally published this assessment is conducted solely at the subspecies level.", "rationale": "This taxon is listed as Endangered on the basis that it has an extent of occurrence of 914 km<sup>2</sup>, and it is considered plausible that it occurs at five or fewer locations defined by a widespread threat from snow loss resulting from climate change. This taxon is subject to multiple stressors, most linked to climate impacts, which are leading to a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat and are likely to reduce the taxon's reproductive success.", "geographicrange": "This taxon is endemic to New South Wales in Australia, where it is restricted to the highlands of the Main Range above 1,500 m asl. This is a well-surveyed taxon in an accessible area, and although there are some unsurveyed parts of its known range which make it difficult to estimate its area of occupancy it is unlikely to have an extent of occurrence substantially greater than presently known.", "population": "This taxon is very abundant where it occurs. A pre-fire population of 10,000 to 10 million has been estimated. No comparisons of population changes over time have been carried out, it is likely that the population is in overall decline in response to habitat loss and degradation. The impacts of the 2019-2020 bushfires on this taxon are unknown, but it is expected that adult and juvenile mortality in areas subject to high-intensity fire could have exceeded 90%, and have been between 30 and 70% elsewhere because they have only been seen using vegetation as refuges which will burn in intense fires. Post-fire survival is likely to be low as they are reliant on vegetation for food and have a strong affinity with water and moist habitats which may not survive high-intensity fires (K. Umbers pers. comm. 2021). Eggs are laid less than 1 cm deep in the soil, and are also likely to have suffered elevated mortality in fire-hit areas. Genetic evidence of fragmentation corresponding to geographical patterns (Slatyer <em>et al</em>. 2014) suggests that the taxon exhibits poor dispersal abilities even over long timescales.&#160;At least some individuals are known disperse less than 50 m in their lifetimes (K. Umbers unpubl. data). There is however some gene flow and as such the taxon is not considered to be severely fragmented.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This is a habitat generalist in subalpine areas, which occurs in grassland, shrubland and heathland, along creek banks, and in open woodland forest (20-50% canopy cover). Individuals can be found in or beneath logs or bark, and in leaf litter and vegetation. Eggs are laid in open patches of soil.", "threats": "The main threats to this high-elevation taxon are likely to be temperature and fire extremes resulting from climate change. It is likely that eggs are dependent on the coverage of a reliable winter snow pack, which insulates eggs in the underlying soil and prevents them from being exposed to subzero temperatures. Projections suggest that with&#160;3\u00b0C of warming&#160; by 2070 this taxon's range may experience snow-free years, with the potential to result in extreme mortality in the overwintering stage (Umbers <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;This taxon's distribution is probably sensitive to drought and fire, and climatic change that increases the frequency of these events may have direct effects on its survival. Shrub encroachment following fire may reduce the availability&#160;of open soil this taxon requires for egg deposition, but this is difficult to ascertain.&#160;The taxon is also subject to predation by foxes and may be susceptible to habitat destruction by horses and pigs. It is possible that an additional threat exists from upslope displacement of related species, which may increase rates of hybridization, but this requires further study. There may be some impact from land use changes within its range, including the Snowy Hydro 2.0 development.", "conservationmeasures": "This taxon occurs within Kosciuszko National Park. Climate change mitigation needs to be the major focus of conservation efforts for this taxon. Consideration of the life cycle of this taxon is necessary when planning burns for bushfire management. Restoration of the habitat is needed in some areas. Minimizing development at higher elevations is recommended, as resort expansions are likely to exacerbate habitat loss already occurring from climate change. There is some control of foxes in the park, and fire management may somewhat reduce declines in this taxon. Research is needed to clarify the impacts of a potential threat from hybridization.", "usetrade": "There is no known use of or trade in this taxon."}]}
