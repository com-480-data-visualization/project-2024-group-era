Some locations are within protected areas (for instance, the Shennongjia National Nature Reserve). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but given the local occurrence of the species, the AOO is not likely to be large (likely smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2). Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest and pollution of streams with pesticides within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is well above the criterion B1 thresholds. Despite its large EOO, this is a locally occurring species with fragmented (possibly severely fragmented) populations and definite threats. With only seven locations known and a relatively small AOO, it is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B2(VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Matrona corephaea</em> is known from seven locations in central and southwest China (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen <em>et al.</em> 2011, Zhang 2019, unpublished).
