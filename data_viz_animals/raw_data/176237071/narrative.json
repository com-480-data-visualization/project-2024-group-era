The maximum extent of occurrence (EOO) based on the area of the minimum convex polygon around the HydroBASIN map is 2,803 km<sup>2</sup>. This species is potentially threatened by the high level of gold mining in the Guiana Shield region.  It is found in two sites in large lowland rivers that are not currently  under development threat, but the species is physiologically fragile  with little to no tolerance for habitat alterations. We therefore infer two locations but no continuing declines. The threat of mining could push the species to becoming Vulnerable or Endangered in a very short time period. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "<em>Rhabdolichops jegui</em>&#160;is known from the Maroni and Mana basins of French Guiana and Suriname (Keith and Meunier 2000).
