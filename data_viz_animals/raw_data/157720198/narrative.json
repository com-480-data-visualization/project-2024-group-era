{"name": "157720198", "result": [{"species_id": 157720198, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Caribbean Sea. It is currently known from one restricted location, in the distinctive and restricted habitat of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at a depth of 2,300 m bsl. As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted AOO and EOO, and has been found at one location, the plausible threat of future anthropogenic influence from deep-sea mining in these sites justifies the assessment of the species as Vulnerable D2. <br/><br/>Whilst no licences have been granted to date, if mining were to be approved within the Cayman Islands EEZ, the projected decline in the extent and quality of habitat would drive this species to Critically Endangered very rapidly. Therefore, an urgent reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements or if there are future changes to the prices of relevant commodities, whereby the assessment would probably increase to CR B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to one location at hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea. This location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with biologically and geologically coherent identity. Any vent fields within this location therefore also have common exposure to relevant potential threats. This location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Cayman Islands, a <span class=\"st\">UK Overseas Territory. The species is currently known from one vent field with active black smokers and diffuse venting located at a depth of 2,300 m bsl, namely the Von Damm vent field on the Mid-Cayman Rise (Nye <em>et al</em>. 2013, Bennett<em> et al.</em> 2015, Plouviez <em>et al.</em> 2015). This species is present over a small area at this vent field.", "population": "This population has only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Nye&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Bennett<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Plouviez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Caribbean Sea. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at a depth of 2,300 m bsl.", "threats": "The Von Damm vent field lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Cayman Islands and is not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al. </em>2018). There are currently no deep-sea mining licences granted within the EEZ of the Cayman Islands (Thaler and Amon 2019). However, this ridge was identified by the international Census of Marine Life as priority target for hydrothermal exploration (Connelly <em>et al.</em> 2012) and, as this area is not subject to international governance and legislation, the Von Damm vent field would be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining were to be permitted. Furthermore, there is currently no protection, such as marine protected areas, in place for these vent fields, leaving a window open for the Cayman Islands to consider the future implementation of mining licences. We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licences to be granted as a significant threat to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at the Von Damm vent field. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites in the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
