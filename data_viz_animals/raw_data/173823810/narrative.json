{"name": "173823810", "result": [{"species_id": 173823810, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Austrolebias bagual </em>is known only from its type locality, a small seasonal pond at 46 m above sea level in Encruzilhada do Sul municipality, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>. The type locality of this species is surrounded and immediately threatened by land-use change associated with rice, wheat, and soy production, which continues to result in declines in Area of Occupancy and habitat quality. Remaining habitat is likely to be destroyed if existing threats are not mitigated. As such, <em>A. bagual</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii). Immediate conservation priorities include site protection, population monitoring, and habitat monitoring. Captive propagation and reintroduction into suitable habitat should be evaluated as conservation priorities.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Austrolebias bagual </em>is known from its type locality, a small seasonal pond at 46 meters above sea level in Encruzilhada do Sul municipality, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The type locality of this species is associated with the Arroyo Abranjo floodplain in the middle course of the Camaqu\u00e3 River basin, Laguna dos Patos system (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</p>  <p>Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a 2x2 km grid overlain on the only known collection locality of this species (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). This species is assigned to a single threat-based location because existing land-use change is impacting the only known collection locality in its entirety.</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size of this species is unknown. However, ichthyological surveys during the original description yielded 0.18 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

Habitat is characterized by direct light exposure, dense aquatic vegetation, brownish-transparent water, depths of approximately 15 cm, and a substrate of mud (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The pond has a surface area of approximately 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</p>", "threats": "<p>The type locality of this species is surrounded and immediately threatened by land-use change associated with rice, wheat, and soy production (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The region surrounding the only known collection locality is dominated by rice plantations (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Hydroelectric infrastructure is planned in the basin, which may influence the type locality by altering natural hydrology (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Area of Occupancy and habitat quality are directly impacted by land-use change (Volcan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

This species is not contained within any existing protected area. Immediate conservation priorities include site protection, habitat monitoring, and population monitoring. <em>Ex-situ</em> propagation and reintroduction into suitable habitat may be warranted. Additional ichthyological survey at the type locality and in any other potentially suitable habitat is urgently needed to clarify the extinction risk of this species.</p>", "usetrade": "<p>This species is not utilized.</p>"}]}
