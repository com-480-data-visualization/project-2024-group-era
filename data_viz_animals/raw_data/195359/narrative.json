It's estimated Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is around 946 km<sup>2</sup>, and its Area of Occupancy (AOO) is 68 km<sup>2</sup>. A continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat has been observed as a result of logging activities and non-timber crops such as tea and rubber plantations. Habitat quality has been degraded due to accumulation of agrochemicals and siltation. These threats are likely to continue as the area is undergoing agricultural expansion and development and there is no current protection for a majority of its habitat. This species is therefore assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>L. ruhuna</em>&#160;is a species endemic to Sri Lanka and is restricted to the Gin to Nilwala river basins in the lowland wet zones (De Silva <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).", "population": "There is no information available on the species population size and population trends of this uncommon species. However, it is possible to infer a decline in the population of this species on the basis of its threats owing to pollution.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species is found in shady, moderately flowing rivulets and streams with sandy substrate (De Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).", "threats": "This species faces threats owing to deforestation for tea and rubber plantations.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no conservation plans or actions in place for this species.", "usetrade": "There are no known uses for this species."}]}
