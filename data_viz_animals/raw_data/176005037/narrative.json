The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 273 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 12 km<sup>2</sup>.

All available records come from the upper Orinoco (Guiana Shield) in Orinoco-Ventuari confluence area. The species&#160;is reported in&#160;14&#160;sites with elevation from 80-120&#160;m above sea level.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 273 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 12 km<sup>2</sup>. Given the impacts associated with the gold mining (deforestation, sedimentation and contamination), there are two threat-based locations.<br/><br/>The geographic attributes for&#160;<em>Myoglanis aspredinoides</em>&#160;in this assessment were compiled, arranged and reviewed from the following sources: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2020), FishNet2 (Fishnet2 2020), FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2019), SiB Colombia (SiB Colombia 2020) and SpeciesLink (SpeciesLink 2020), and complemented with records from the databases of the following ichthyological collections from Colombia: CZUT-IC (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica, Universidad del Tolima, Ibagu\u00e9), IAvH-P (Colecci\u00f3n de Peces de Agua Dulce del Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n de Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos Alexander von Humboldt, Villa de Leyva), ICN-MHN (Instituto de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1), IMCN (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica de Referencia Cient\u00edfica del Museo de Ciencias Naturales Federico Carlos Lehmann Valencia del INCIVA, Cali), and MPUJ (Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural \"Lorenzo Uribe, S.J.\" de la Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot\u00e1), and Venezuela: MCNG (Museo de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Nacional Experimental de los Llanos Occidentales Ezequiel Zamora, Guanare, Venezuela) and CPUCLA (Colecci\u00f3n Regional de Peces, Museo de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado, Barquisimeto, Venezuela).", "population": "There are not adequate data to estimate the global population size and trend of <em>Myoglanis aspredinoides.&#160;</em>Even when regional rivers are conserved (Lasso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), the species is rare in the samples. Illegal gold mining is expanding in several tributaries of the Alto Orinoco, including Ventuari River (Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2006), with severe impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, which also affect local rivers, and may affect the population of the species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Very little is known about the habitat of&#160;<em>Myoglanis aspredinoides</em>. It inhabits stagnant pools in streams and rivers formed by rocks and around 2 m of maximum depth, with clear waters and sandy and muddy bottom (DoNascimiento and Lundberg 2005).", "threats": "<em>Myoglanis aspredinoides</em> inhabits one of the most conserved drainages of the Guiana Shield in Venezuela. However, the biggest threat is the expansion of illegal gold mining, with the consequent contamination and sedimentation of the riverbeds: this is reported inside the Yapacana National Park where the few reports of the species are.", "conservationmeasures": "It is not known whether there are laws, regulations and educational programs specifically oriented to its protection. Conservation sites and protected areas occur within its distribution (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020). The species is reported in National Park Yapacana and possibly is present in Natural Monument Cerro Guanai and National Park Serran\u00eda Yutaj\u00e9. Site and habitat protection are recommended, as well as research into the population size and distribution, threats and habitat.", "usetrade": "There is no use/trade information for this species"}]}
