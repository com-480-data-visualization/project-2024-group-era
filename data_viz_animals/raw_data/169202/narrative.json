{"name": "169202", "result": [{"species_id": 169202, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Overall, the species is known from 15 records at four locations; two of these are considered under threat, whilst the other two are not. The species is assessed as Endangered (B1ab(iii), B2ab(iii)) due to the restricted area of occupancy&#160; (24 km\u00b2), being present in just four locations and an ongoing decline in habitat area and quality. The locality in Nigeria needs a survey, since the records are more than 50 years old. The given locality \"Obudu\" refers most likely to the Obudu Plateau.", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from a few locations in Cameroon (Mt Kupe and Bakossi Mts (Kodmin/Kumin) in adjacent SW Cameroon, and Baba II Forest near Babenda (Dijkstra pers. comm.)). The species is also known from the Obudu Plateau of SE Nigeria (type locality), but these records are from 1961 and 1962 and surveys are needed to see, whether the population is still extant.", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Rocky submontane (above 700 m Asl) rainforest streams.", "threats": "The specific threats to the species in the highlands of Cameroon are unknown but forest destruction (selective logging and for agricultural expansion) is believed to be potential threat.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures known but information on taxonomy, population ecology, habitat status and population trends would be valuable.", "usetrade": null}]}
