There are four locations. Industrial development has already destroyed a number of subpopulations in the Aloes-Coega flats area. Further development of the area and airborne pollution remain a concern. Informal settlements are a future threat. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Endangered under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, from the Sundays River and Aloes-Coega area near Port Elizabeth.", "population": "The population is declining.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species occurs on dry, sandy and limestone ridges at an altitude of 30 m to 150 m.", "threats": "Industrial development has already destroyed a number of localities in the Aloes-Coega flats area. Only one subpopulation is within a reserve, created for the butterfly by the Coega Industrial Development Zone. Further development and airborne pollution is causing ongoing loss and degradation of habitat. An informal settlement near Coega village has been disbanded and relocated. Informal settlements remain a future threat, such as the possible expansion of Motherwell township into the Coega area, which is of major concern. Other threats include alien vegetation.", "conservationmeasures": "A special reserve for the butterfly has been established at Coega at a location named Butterfly Valley. Further research on this species may be beneficial.", "usetrade": null}]}
