It has a relatively restricted distribution with an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 7,814 km<sup>2</sup>. Although dam impacts are known in the historical distribution, it is unclear whether such impacts have negatively affected the species or not. Two locations are counted based on the threat of damming. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened B1a pending more detailed surveys in the area of the Brokopondo reservoir in order to decide whether such impacts have reduced the extent and quality of the distribution of this species.", "geographicrange": "The species is known from the upper and middle Suriname river basin (Weber <em>et al. </em>2012). The type locality (Boeseman 1968) was destroyed by the construction of the Brokopondo reservoir, although the species as been recorded afterwards in the general area (Schmidt and Nijssen 1980).", "population": "No population assessments are known for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "No specific habitat information is known for this species.", "threats": "Between one quarter and one half of its distribution was covered by the Brokopondo reservoir, including the former type locality (Schimdt and Nijssen 1980).", "conservationmeasures": "Part of the distribution includes the Brownsberg Natural Park on the west margin of the Brokopondo reservoir.", "usetrade": "No uses are known for this species."}]}
