However, given that the species has such a restricted range it assessed as Near Threatened to recognise the vulnerability of these limestone outcrops if the protected park status was no longer in operation or the forest quality was reduced. If further surveys show that the distribution is more widespread then a reassessment would be required.", "geographicrange": "This species was described in 2014, and to date this species is only  known to occur at two neighbouring limestone rock outcrops, Gua Bewah  and Gua Taat (4\u00b051'3\"N, 102\u00b043'21\"E) at the southern part of Tasik  Kenyir, a man-made lake in Peninsular Malaysia (Liew <em>et al</em>. 2014).", "population": "There is insufficient information to determine the population trends, but given the current habitat status it is probably stable.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "This species is found on limestone outcrops.", "threats": "The presence on islands within a lake in the protected area is considered to provide suitable protection from most park users and as such the species, whilst having a restricted range, is not considered to be threatened (Liew&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).", "conservationmeasures": "The sites occupied by this species are within Taman Negara Pahang, which is a prioritised protected area (Liew&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).
