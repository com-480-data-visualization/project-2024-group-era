Information about population size and habitat preferences is missing. It is assessed as Near Threatened as it has a small area of occupancy (AOO) and some of known the localities for this species are close to sites with strong human influence.", "geographicrange": "<em>Metaphya elongata </em> is endemic to New Caledonia.", "population": "There is no information available on population size.&#160;Davies (2002) mentions that it is quite abundant in the right places in the right times. The species has thus far been recorded from the south of the island but the northern parts have been less well explored and it is likely that the species is present there also.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "The habitat and ecology of this species is unknown although due to its distribution it is likely to be at least partly dependant on forest habitats.", "threats": "Although no details are known about the habitat preference of this species, it is thought to be partly dependent on forest habitats from its distribution and therefore be affected by habitat degradation in the form of forest extraction.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no known conservation measures known in place.", "usetrade": null}]}
