{"name": "157866293", "result": [{"species_id": 157866293, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents along the East Pacific Rise in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from nine restricted locations in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 2,200 m to 2,845 m bsl. This species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields and has a restricted area of occupancy (AOO), suggesting that it would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. While one of the nine locations lies within two Marine Protected Areas (Menini and Van Dover 2019), the other eight exist in International Waters without any such protection, therefore we have opted to assess the species as NT.&#160;The presence of the species across a large geographical area owing to the spread of hydrothermal vent fields across ocean ridges might give cause for LC, however, this vent species is endemic to vent environments and only occupies a small area of suitable habitat (~36 km\u00b2) which is significantly below the VU category threshold for AOO under criterion B. Therefore, it would only take a small number of mining events to drive the species to extinction and a&#160;reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of the MPAs or&#160;in the event of mining licences being granted, whereby the species would be capable of becoming VU B2ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to nine locations at hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise in the Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.&#160;This species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2200 m bsl to 2,845 m bsl. Location 1 occurs within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mexico, whereas the remaining eight locations occur beyond national jurisdiction in International Waters. The species has been observed from the following vent fields in these locations: EPR 21\u00b0N (Location 1), EPR 13\u00b0N (Location 2), Feather Duster (Location 3), EPR 9\u00b050'N (Location 4), EPR 7\u00b025'S (Location 5), EPR 14\u00b0S (Location 6), Rehu-Marka (Location 7), Rapa Nui (Location 8), and EPR 48'S Axial Dome (Location 9) (McLean 1988, War\u00e9n and Bouchet 2001, Dreyer 2004, Blake 2006, Mills <em>et al.</em> 2007, Matabos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (McLean 1988, War\u00e9n and Bouchet 2001, Dreyer 2004, Blake 2006, Mills&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Matabos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2,200 m to 2,845 m bsl.", "threats": "Eight of the nine vent locations lie within International Waters and are subject to International Seabed Authority (ISA) governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulfide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. There are currently no deep-sea mining licences granted for vent fields within the East Pacific Rise. However, the ISA has granted numerous exploration licences to date in other areas like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, so there is reason for concern.&#160;ISA exploration-phase licences allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing. Both direct impacts from mineral extraction and indirect disturbance from adjacent activities could impact local subpopulations. Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller<em> et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. These vent fields would be susceptible to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted. We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licences to be granted as a significant threat to the species. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Of the vent fields that this species inhabits, only one currently faces no threats owing to the significant protection provided by two MPAs. The EPR 21\u00b0N vent field lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mexico and is protected by two MPAs established in 2009 and 2016, respectively: the Hydrothermal Ventilation Sanctuary of the Guaymas Basin and the&#160;Eastern Pacific Ridge (Santuario&#160;Ventilas Hidrotermales de la Cuenca de Guaymas y de la Dorsal del Pac\u00edfico Oriental) and the Deep Mexican Pacific Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera&#160;Pac\u00edfico Mexicano Profundo) (Menini and Van Dover 2009). The exploitation of wildlife and mining in these areas is strictly prohibited.&#160;We therefore do not consider there to be any threat to EPR 21\u00b0N at this time.", "conservationmeasures": "One of the nine locations, the EPR 21\u00b0N vent field, lies within the Hydrothermal Ventilation Sanctuary of the Guaymas Basin and the&#160;Eastern Pacific Ridge (Santuario&#160;Ventilas Hidrotermales de la Cuenca de Guaymas y de la Dorsal del Pac\u00edfico Oriental), established in 2009, where research and fisheries activities are regulated by the Mexican government (Menini and Van Dover 2019). This vent site is further surrounded by the Deep Mexican Pacific Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera&#160;Pac\u00edfico Mexicano Profundo), established in 2016 (Menini and Van Dover 2019). The exploitation of wildlife and mining in these areas is strictly prohibited. There are no conservation actions currently in place at the remaining eight locations where this species is found. We recommend that specific national/international legislation is required for the protection of deep-sea habitats and resources.&#160;Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the East Pacific Rise.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
