Introduced species, solid waste pollution, and raw sewage discharge have likely resulted in a reduction in the quality of available habitat. However, the scope and impact of these threats require further study. Given an Extent of Occurrence that falls within the minimum threshold for a threatened category, threats that have probably impacted the quality of available habitat, but an unknown number of locations, this species is assessed as Near Threatened. More information regarding the scope of potential threats and their impacts may result in assessment under a threatened category.", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Brycon chagrensis</em> is distributed in the Chagres River and Cocle del Norte river drainage and adjacent tributaries on the Atlantic versant of central Panama (Reeves and Birmingham 2006, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013), including Lake Gatun and Lake Alajuela (Sharpe <em>et al</em>. 2017). This species is also distributed in the Rio Grande on the Pacific versant of Panama following migration through the Panama Canal (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004).</p>  Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be approximately 4,680 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2019).

Additionally, the invasive Asian fish tapeworm <em>Bothriocephalus acheilognathi</em> has been reported from the Chagres River and likely parasitizes a broad range of fishes within the drainage (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2013). Solid waste and raw sewage discharge from urban centres have the potential to negatively impact water quality (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez <em>et al</em>. 2002).
