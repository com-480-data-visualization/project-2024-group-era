{"name": "196329994", "result": [{"species_id": 196329994, "taxonomicnotes": "Differences in morphological, ecological and behavioural traits suggest that the current five-species arrangement does not accurately reflect species diversity within<em> Kosciuscola</em> (Tatarnic <em>et al.</em> 2013, Umbers <em>et al.</em> 2021). Molecular work has identified species-level clades within <em>K. cuneatus</em>, with strong evidence that <em>K. cuneatus</em> proper is restricted to the Australian Capital Territory and northern New South Wales mountains (Umbers<em> et al.</em> 2021) and the remaining clades within<em> K. cuneatus</em> are undescribed species.<br/><br/>The recent emergence of major threats from climate change and bushfire, combined with the narrow ranges of these taxa as now understood, is here considered sufficient to justify assessing the reduced species concept of&#160;<em>K. cuneatus&#160;</em>pending formal publication of the forthcoming taxonomic revision, and to assess the undescribed congeners.", "rationale": "This undescribed species is listed as Endangered on the basis that it has an extent of occurrence of less than 3,000 km<sup>2</sup>, it is considered to occur in two or three locations defined by a threat from fire, and multiple threats including both fire and temperature extremes driven by climate change are resulting in an ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat. The impact of the 2019-2020 bushfire season on the number of mature individuals in this species is unclear, but an expected increase in the frequency and severity of fires will result in a projected continuing decline in the number of mature individuals and the area of occupancy,", "geographicrange": "This undescribed species occurs in the Snowy Mountains from southern New South Wales to northern Victoria in Australia. It has an elevational range of 1,000-1,600 m asl.", "population": "This species is moderately common in suitable habitat but can be difficult to detect. Should the frequency and intensity of bushfires within this species' range increase as expected, then by analogy with the impacts of the 2019-2020 bushfire season on other species this grasshopper will presumably decline.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This flightless species occurs in alpine meadows and shrubland at and above the tree line, usually in open woodland but not in closed canopy forest. There is no information on breeding, but based on other species in the genus, it may rely on snow to protect the eggs laid in shallow ground from extreme temperatures. The adult stage needs water and desiccation of the habitat will be detrimental but does not appear to be as dependent on water sources as<em> Kosciuscola</em> species.", "threats": "Bushfires are an increasing threat to this species and around 50% of the northern part of its range was impacted in the 2019-2020 bushfires (from overlaying fire impacted areas with known range - National Environment Science Program unpubl. data). It will be impacted by other fire events in the future. Invasive species including foxes and feral cats prey upon the species, and horses disturb the species and degrade the habitat. Climate change is an increasing threat to this species, causing drying of the habitat, shorter periods of snow cover and increasing bushfires. There is some disturbance within the national park from tourism. Fire management may be detrimental to this species especially if conducted in autumn.", "conservationmeasures": "This species it occurs in Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales, and in Alpine National Park in Victoria. Climate change mitigation needs to be the major focus of conservation efforts for this species. Consideration of the life cycle of this species is necessary when planning burns for bushfire management. Restoration of the habitat is needed in some areas. Minimizing development at higher elevations is recommended, as resorts are likely to exacerbate habitat loss already resulting from climate change.", "usetrade": "There is no known use of or trade in this species."}]}
