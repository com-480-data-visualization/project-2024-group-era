{"name": "176025489", "result": [{"species_id": 176025489, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This species is restricted to a number of localities in the Orinoco River basin. The maximum area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at 840 km<sup>2</sup>. It is a very rare species with particular habitat requirements. Mining is a severe threat that is leading to a continuing decline in the habitat extent and quality. There are 7-10 locations based on this threat. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.<br/></p>", "geographicrange": "<p>This species is known from the Orinoco Basin in Venezuela in Colombia, including the Caura river basin (Tabare and Nichare rivers) and the main channel of the upper Orinoco river (Bonilla <em>et al.</em> 1999, Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p>", "population": "<p>It is apparently a very rare species in its natural environment.<strong></strong></p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>It occurs in rivers of black and clear waters, with torrential water. It has only been observed in areas of rapids or streams of large rivers (Orinoco, Caura: Nichare and Tabaro) (Bonilla <em>et al.</em> 1999).<strong></strong></p>", "threats": "<p>A severe threat to this species is mining, which is widespread within the Orinoco in the Orinoco Mining Arc. Mining is for bauxite, copper, coltan, diamonds, iron and gold. It leads to deforestation, riverbed alteration, sedimentation, contamination by heavy metals, and spills of gasoline, oil and human sewage (CERLAS 2019).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>No conservation actions are known to be in place for this species. Site protection and further research are recommended.<br/></p>", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
