It also has been reported in highland streams and lagoons (Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Diet is comprised primarily of terrestrial insects, but also includes aquatic insects and diatoms (Bussing 1998). Maximum reported body size is 5.5 cm total length (TL) (Bussing 1998), however, aquarium specimens can reach up to 7 cm TL (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019). Reproduction occurs throughout the year (Bussing 1998); approximately every 28 days, female gives birth to 10-30 young (Wischnath 1993). This species can be very aggressive, even to their own young (Wischnath 1993).</p>", "threats": "<p>Expansive agriculture has led to the deforestation of much of the Tusubres, Pirr\u00eds and Terraba River drainage (Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2001, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2015). As a result, sedimentation rates have increased and have likely resulted in a decline in the quality of habitat available to <em>B. rhabdophora</em>, particularly in lower-lying regions (Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2001). Additionally, reductions in tree cover have reduced dry-season flow rates (Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2018). Completion of the proposed Boruca dam is likely to have major ecological impacts on the hydrology of the Terraba River basin (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Existing subpopulations have been extirpated due to expanding hydroelectric infrastructure (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019). Discharge from plantation agriculture has resulted in increased sedimentation, nutrient loading, and chemical pollution (Rojas and Rodriguez 2008).</p>  While the scope and magnitude of these threats are uncertain, they are producing continuous inferred declines in the quality and availability of habitat, and in the number of subpopulations.", "conservationmeasures": "<p></p><p>There are currently no species-specific conservation actions directed towards <em>B. rhabdophora</em>.
