An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large.

An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large. The AOO will be declining as a result of loss and degradation of hill forest across most of the range of the species.
