Dijkstra (2007) considers <em>C. hasta</em> as a good species and as closely related to <em>C. tenuis</em> Longfield, 1936, of which it might even be a synonym.", "rationale": "The species is listed as Endangered B1ab(iii) due to its extent of occurrence (EOO) of 2,981 km\u00b2, an area of occupancy (AOO) of 20 km\u00b2 and four locations, of which two are outside a protected area. All the records (four localities) are in or around the Mahale Mountains along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. Due to a drastic human population increase the locations outside the Mahale NP are most likely not anymore in the condition to keep populations of the Mahale Jewel. The Mahale Jewel seems to be a rather localised endemic species of the eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika.", "geographicrange": "All the records are around the Mahale Mountains along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika (\"Lumbugwe River, Kasangazi\", eastern shores of Lake Tanganyica (Tanzania)).
