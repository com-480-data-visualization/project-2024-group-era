While there are currently no major threats to the lake, the introduction of non-native species or changes to current land-use around the lake are plausible future threats that have the potential to considerably increase the extinction risk of this species.

This species is known from very few museum collections (GBIF 2019), and additional sampling is needed to determine if range extends outside of the crater lake. </p>  Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and area of Occupancy (AOO) do not exceed 10 km<sup>2</sup>, based on the available georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2019) and the current assumption that this species is restricted to the crater lake.", "population": "<p>Total population size is unknown.
