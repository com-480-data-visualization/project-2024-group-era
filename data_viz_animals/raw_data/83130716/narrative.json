The latest study on the island established it from one locality only where it was recorded as uncommon (Englund 2011). The species is believed to have a narrow habitat preference and although there are no documented threats for the moment there is a potential risk to its survival in any possible water abstraction, derivation or pollution. Therefore the species is assessed as Endangered, based on its restricted range, small number of locations, and projected threats.", "geographicrange": "This speies is endemic to&#160;Babeldaob&#160;Island,&#160;Palau (Lieftinck 1962).", "population": "The population size is unknown. It was reported in three studies only (Lieftinck 1962, Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2003, Englund 2011). Englund (2011) investigated the freshwater habitats on the whole island and recorded <em>Pseudagrion palauense&#160;</em>in one locality only where it was established as uncommon.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "According to Englund (2011) <em>Pseudagrion palauense</em>&#160;appears to have have a narrow habitat preference.&#160;The species inhabits streams around riffle/chute in shaded area.", "threats": "No threats to this species are documented. The latest survey of Englund (2011) established it from one locality only which is a potential threat to the long term existence because any type of water abstraction, deviation or pollution might severely affect the population of this endemic species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures on place. More studies are required to establish the population size, trend and threats to this species. Monitoring of the only known locality is essential.", "usetrade": null}]}
