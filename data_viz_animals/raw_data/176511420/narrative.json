The area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is 216 km<sup>2</sup>. Threats not only in close proximity to its habitat, but also those that are present in the same hydrological basin (especially those upstream), are considered and include the forestation and desiccation of wetlands to prevent flooding and to gain area for soy and rice crops. There is an inferred continuing decline in the AOO, extent of occurrence (EOO) and habitat quality based on these threats. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "<em>Austrolebias bellotti</em> inhabits seasonal wetlands of the Lower Parana and Lower Uruguay ecoregions (according to Abell <em>et al</em>. (2008) classification).<br/><br/>Distributional data on this species are very detailed, based on  intensive and extensive field sampling recorded in National Collections from Argentina and Uruguay (1960-2020), and a bibliographical revision (Boschi 1957, Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2012).", "population": "There is no information on the population trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The habitat for&#160;<em>Austrolebias bellottii</em>, as with other annual fishes of the genus, is flatland seasonal ponds that remain dry on average for four months (from late spring to autumn, in the southern hemisphere). Dry conditions are necessary for successful embryo development and viability (Berois<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014). Soils with high percentage of clay seem to be the best for egg deposition. The minimum wet period for individuals to reach maturity and reproduce is around two months; reproduction is continuous from adulthood to death (Berois&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2018, 2019). Ponds may be filled by rains or adjacent stream floods. Adults are found in a wide range of water temperatures from 6\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C, but higher temperatures could reduce survival. <em>Austrolebias </em>species feeds on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (microcrustaceans, oligochaetes, insect larvae, arachnids, etc.) (Laufer <em>et al</em>. 2009). Potential predators are large annual (<em>A. elongatus</em>) and non-annual (Erythrinidae, Heptapteridae) fish species, insect larvae, aquatic snakes and birds.", "threats": "Threats to <em>Austrolebias bellottii</em> are:&#160;<br/><ol><li>Annual &amp; perennial non-timber crops. The distribution of this species is in areas used for soy crops.&#160;&#160;</li><li>Fishing &amp; harvesting aquatic resources. Annual fishes are very popular in the pet trade, and national regulations of collecting activities are not tight.&#160;&#160;</li><li>Abstraction of surface water (agricultural use). Soy crops modify freshwater courses that may affect annual fish populations by draining natural wetlands.</li><li>Urbanization. This has destroyed several seasonal wetlands where this species used to occur.&#160;</li><li>Nutrient loads. Soy crops use high quantities of fertilisers that may cause eutrophication in seasonal ponds.&#160;</li><li>Herbicides and pesticides. Soy crops use high quantities of these substances that may reduce subpopulation viability (Zebral <em>et al.</em> 2018).</li><li>Droughts. Considering global climate change predictions, severe droughts for more than two consecutive years may eliminate subpopulations of annual fishes. &#160;&#160;</li><li>Storms &amp; flooding.
