{"name": "161327414", "result": [{"species_id": 161327414, "taxonomicnotes": "There are no notable issues.", "rationale": "This is a range-restricted, endemic species of the Wakkerstroom area in Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces, South Africa (Extent of Occurrence 153 km<sup>2</sup>, Area of Occupancy 16 km<sup>2</sup>). There are six locations, with a potential plausible future threat of habitat modification from fire, drought and alien invasive plants. Mining and farming are also possible threats, as are overgrazing and unseasonal fires during the flight period. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga Provinces in South Africa, from around Wakkerstroom in Mpumalanga and in neighbouring KwaZulu-Natal Province.", "population": "There is no information currently available, but the population is suspected to be stable.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "This species occurs in Wakkerstroom Montane Grassland at high altitude, along steep, grassy slopes below the rocky ridges of the escarpment. The habitat comprises steep south-facing grassy slopes, gullies and nearby grassland, associated with populations of Ouhout, <em>Leucosidea sericea</em>. It has been found at altitudes above 1,900 m.", "threats": "While the habitat is fairly remote, there is a threat of modification from fire, drought and alien invasive plants. Mining and farming are also possible threats as are overgrazing and unseasonal fires during the flight period.", "conservationmeasures": "Further exploration of the area around Wakkerstroom, Utrecht and Groenvlei is required to identify additional subpopulations. Protection and suitable management of sites would be beneficial.&#160;Research is needed into its life history, ecology/habitat requirements, and monitoring of known subpopulations is recommended to determine the population size and trends.", "usetrade": null}]}
