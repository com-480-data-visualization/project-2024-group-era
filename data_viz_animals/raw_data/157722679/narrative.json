{"name": "157722679", "result": [{"species_id": 157722679, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to hydrothermal vents at deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from five restricted locations, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 600 to 1,650 m bsl, and would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if commercial deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. The potential for anthropogenic influence at this site based on exploration licences for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites supports a projected continuing decline in quality of habitat. There may already be disturbance to this species as Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC)&#160;is in the process of testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing. The impact of uncertainty around the decline in habitat means that the applicable threat level for this species ranges from VU to EN, using the recommended risk tolerance. We have opted to take a precautionary approach based on this level of uncertainty and therefore assessed the species as the top of this range, Endangered B2ab(iii). A reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to five locations at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.&#160;All locations lie within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 600 m bsl to 1650 m bsl. It has been observed from six vent fields: at the Minami-Ensei Knoll&#160;vent field (Location 1), North Knoll Iheya Ridge vent field (Location 2), Izena Cauldron vent field (Location 2), Irabu Knoll&#160;vent field (Location 3), SPOT Hatoma Knoll&#160;vent field (Location 4), and Daiyon Yonaguni Knoll&#160;vent field (Location 5) (Okutani 1993, Nakamura <em>et al.</em> 2014, Watanabe and Kojima 2015). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated or human-occupied vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Okutani 1993, Nakamura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Watanabe and Kojima 2015).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 600 to 1,650 m bsl.", "threats": "The six vent fields lie within the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone and are not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al.</em> 2018). The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) has developed test mining equipment, which targets seafloor massive sulfides and is in the process of conducting verification tests (Shirayama <em>et al.</em> 2017). Polymetallic sulphide resource exploration can include some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation phases, hence there may already be disturbance of the subpopulation. As well as direct impacts, evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. We therefore consider the current exploratory mining and the likelihood of future exploitative mining licences within the Japan EEZ to be a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at any vent fields within the Japan EEZ. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites within the region.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
