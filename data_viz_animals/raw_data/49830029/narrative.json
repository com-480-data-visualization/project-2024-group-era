It is important to note that identification of <em>Astroblepus </em>species is very difficult, so the true extent of this species' distribution is unknown at this time. Given the widespread habitat destruction and alteration in mountain  rivers and streams, it is likely that this species has suffered  significant a population reduction. There are a best estimate of two locations based on these threats. Continuing decline in habitat and population size is inferred. Therefore, <em>Astroblepus mariae</em> is classified as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Astroblepus mariae</em> occurs in Colombia in the Orinoco and Pacific slope rivers basins (Maldonado-Ocampo <em>et al. </em>2008). Its type locality is a brook the near small village of Choachi, 25 kilometers east of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, at an elevation of 1,800 meters&#160;(Fowler&#160;1919).

The male identified in the type description had big diptera larvae in the pharynx (Fowler 1919). The habitat includes small, shallow creeks, and springs characterized by rocks, stones, gravel and mud, and diverse riverine vegetation. Its ability to climb (Johnson 1912, Buitrago-Su\u00e1rez 1995) enables its to explore habitats that are unreachable for other species of fish.", "threats": "Several rivers drainages where <em>Astroblepus mariae</em>&#160;occurs are threatened by urban and agricultural activities.
