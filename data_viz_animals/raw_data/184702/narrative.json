{"name": "184702", "result": [{"species_id": 184702, "taxonomicnotes": "Morphologically this is a very distinctive species.", "rationale": "This species is restricted to the type locality in the Kano Plain, east of Lake Victoria. The area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is 4 km<sup>2</sup>. The quality of habitat is rapidly declining owing to expanding agricultural schemes and human domestic activities, which pose high risks to this restricted species. There exists no mention of <em>G. barthi</em>&#160;since its original description in 1980 and it was not recollected during a survey 2006-2008. Therefore, this species is Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct).", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Kano Plain, east of Winam (formerly Kavirondo) Gulf, Lake Victoria, Kenya (an area of less than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>) (Brown 1994). It does not occur in Lake Victoria itself.", "population": "There is no information available on the population. No specimens were recovered during a 2006-2008 survey.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is found in seasonal water pools/small watercourses.", "threats": "Siltation, agricultural development and pollution may threaten this species. Sugar cane and rice plantation expansions (Kano Plain Development Initiative, KPDI) are reclaiming regional wetlands (KPDI 2013). Also, increased water abstraction for the expanding regional human population and increasing domestic pollution may have a negative effect.", "conservationmeasures": "No information is available on conservation actions.", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
