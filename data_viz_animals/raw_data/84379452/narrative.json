Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 12,550 km\u00b2, but its area of occupancy (AOO) is well below 500 km\u00b2. Due to the growing human population the pressure on its habitat (streamlets in primary forest) is immense and both its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are declining. Monitoring is needed to confirm which populations are stable and where urgent conservation measures are needed for this species.", "geographicrange": "This species has been recorded from very few point localities in the Northwest and Southwest Provinces of Cameroon and from the Bakossi Moutains in Nigeria (a doubtful record far away from the Bakossi Mountains is not considered valid). It seems to be restricted to forest streamlets between 1,500 and 1,900 m altitude (Dijkstra, Kipping and M\u00e9zi\u00e8re 2015).", "population": "There is no information available on the population size of the Blue-shouldered Yellowwing.
