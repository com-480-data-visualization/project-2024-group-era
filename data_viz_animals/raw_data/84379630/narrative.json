{"name": "84379630", "result": [{"species_id": 84379630, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This morphologically distinct species was only recently (2008) discovered from one site in southern Cameroon (forested Kienk\u00e9 River at Kiribi in South Province at sea level) (Dijkstra, Kipping and M\u00e9zi\u00e8re 2015). Since such habitats are easily accessible and the species is conspicuous, it is considered as a locally endemic species. It is assessed as Critically Endangered because of its small extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). Since the species is only known from one location, a precautionary AOO and EOO of 5 km\u00b2 is used. The habitat, where the species is found, is declining (forest destruction, water pollution and siltation). More research is needed to gather more detailed information on population size and trends, AOO, EOO, and habitat requirements for this species.", "geographicrange": "This species is known from only one site: at the Kienk\u00e9 River close to Kribi in southern Cameroon.", "population": "No information is available on population size or trends for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is known from habitat around large forested rivers in low altitude areas (southern Cameroon).", "threats": "Habitat degradation is the most likely threat to this species, although we do not have enough information yet. It is only known from one site along a forested (degraded forest) river and ongoing deforestation and water pollution are the main threats in the area. Currently more surveys are needed to get an confirm the species area of occupancy and extent of occurrence.", "conservationmeasures": "There is urgent need to gather more distribution data for this species (to be able to confirm its&#160;area of occupancy and extent of occurrence&#160;).
