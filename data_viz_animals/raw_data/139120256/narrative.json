An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, however it is unlikely to be large (likely smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2). Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of suitable habitat within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is well above the thresholds for criterion B1. Despite its relatively large EOO, this is a locally occurring species with fragmented (possibly severely fragmented) populations and definite threats. With only six locations known, it is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B2 (VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Matrona oreades </em>is known from six localities in China (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen <em>et al.</em> 2011), however we cannot assign coordinates to one of the localities (an old specimen found in a museum collection) so that only five data points are included in the map. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, however it is unlikely to be large and with the available data is probably below 2,000 km\u00b2.
