It is suspected to have declined by 30-40% in the last 10 years due to drought and dams, and this population decline is predicted to continue at the same rate over the next 10 years due to the same reasons.

Droughts in Gomal and Zhob rivers are responsible for reduced flow and stagnation of pools in which the species is susceptible to predation and competition (Xie<em> et al.</em> 2013, Khan 2016, M.
