{"name": "191188", "result": [{"species_id": 191188, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Chirostoma sphyraena</em> is endemic to Lake Chapala in the Lerma River basin, Mexico where it is primarily threatened by over fishing. Decline in pescados blancos (whitefish) throughout Chapala and a low number of captured specimens between 2005 - 2013 suggests declines in the number of mature individuals of the species. While the population size is unknown, it is inferred that the species is subject to declines (as are all whitefish) in Chapala. A continuing decline of its habitat quality has also been reported as a result of pollution and over-extraction of water resources. The species has one location and an EOO of 1407 km<sup>2</sup>; therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "The species is e<span>ndemic to Lerma River basin, Mexico and has been found within Lake Chapala and surrounding small streams (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2005). This Silverside has been introduced in the States of Durango and Chihuahua (N. Mercado-Silva pers. comm. 2018).", "population": "In Lake Chapala, production according to species composition for the year 2000, no longer considers \"pescado blanco\" (whitefish), as it hasn't been registered since 1990 due to its alarmingly low abundance (Rojas and Sasso 2005). <em>Chirostoma sphyraena</em>, a whitefish, has seen declines in collections and, in 2005, 2010 and 2013, the species was rare (N. Mercado-Silva pers. comm. 2018).", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "Known to occur in freshwater rivers and lakes.The species is carnivore and a zooplanktivore (Mercado-Silva <em>et al</em>., 2015).", "threats": "<p>The primary threats to species of&#160;<em>Chirostoma</em>&#160;are habitat loss and degradation resulting from waterflow reductions from the Lerma River and an associated increased water residency time, nutrient enrichment due to agricultural runoff, the release of toxins and pollutants from municipal and industrial sources, overfishing and potential stock collapse, competitive nonnative species (e.g.,&#160;<em>Oreochromis aureus</em>) and physical habitat alteration (Lyons <em>et al. </em>1998, Becerra-Mu\u00f1oz <em>et al.</em> 2003, de Anda<em> et al. </em>2004, Moncayo-Estrada <em>et al.</em> 2012). Recent estimates suggest that over 3000 fishermen target various species of fishes in Lake Chapala annually (SAGARPA 2015).<br/><br/>Additionally, Lake Chapala has experienced a long-term continual decline in water volume primarily resulting from increased agricultural demand for ground and surface water (comprising the majority of water-use in the region) (SAGARPA 2015). Low water volume may be exacerbated by climatic fluctuations (Filonov<em> et al. </em>2001, Filonov 2002) and by increases in surface transpiration due to nutrient-induced presence of floating macrophytes (Lind and Davalos-Lind 2002). Actions against water level reductions have been implemented by the Lerma Chapala watershed commission.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "The species is covered by the responsible fisheries regulation for the lake Chapala: \"NORMA Oficial Mexicana NOM-032-SAG/PESC-2015\" (SAGARPA 2015).&#160;This standard establishes the minimum catch size for white fish species (<em>Chirostoma promelas, C. sphyraena and C. lucius</em>) of 200 mm total length.", "usetrade": "<em>C. sphyraena</em>, like<em> C. Lucius and C. promelas</em>, is considered a \"pescado blanco\" and as such, reaches a high market value for human consumption (SAGARPA 2015, Estrada and Garc\u00eda 2003)."}]}
