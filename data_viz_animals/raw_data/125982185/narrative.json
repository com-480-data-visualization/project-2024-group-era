Here we endorse the latter assessment that <em>Limia </em>should be considered a valid, separate genus.<br/><br/>The taxonomic role of genera to express relationships among species is clearly justified in the case of <em>Limia </em>from different points of view. From the biogeographic point of view, species of <em>Limia </em>show  a discrete distribution since they are only found in the Antilles,  specifically on Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica and the island of Grand  Cayman. However, only three species of <em>Poecilia sensu strictu </em>occur in this region and they are restricted exclusively to Hispaniola. In addition, recent phylogenetic analyses have found <em>Limia </em>to be a monophyletic group probably originated from a South American ancestor with the three Hispaniolan <em>Poecilia </em>species mentioned above representing the closest sister group (Palacios <em>et al. </em>2016, Weaver <em>et al.</em> 2016). A very detailed analysis is currently in prep, also confirming <em>Limia </em>as monophyletic (Spikes <em>et al.</em>  in prep). Moreover, there is enough morphological distinctiveness in  characters with adaptive value such is the case of gonopodial traits to  separate species of <em>Limia </em>and <em>Poecilia </em>(Rivas 1978). Furthermore, all of the existing ecological and behavioral literature is using <em>Limia</em>, not <em>Poecilia</em>. Not recognizing <em>Limia </em>as a separate genus from <em>Poecilia </em>may obscure their similarities and cause even more confusion in a group that in fact deserves more taxonomic attention.", "rationale": "<p></p><p><em>Limia versicolor</em> occurs in the Haina River drainage and southward draining streams in the central and southeastern Dominican Republic. Extent of Occurrence is estimated to be 91-564 km<sup>2</sup>, but limited ichthyological survey in this region and the existence of potentially suitable habitat in adjacent drainages introduces considerable uncertainty. Although total population size and population trend are unknown, <em>L. versicolor</em> is not a dominant species in the habitats where the species occurs with introduced poeciliids. Several threats are pervasive in the Haina River drainage, including deforestation and soil erosion associated with smallholder agriculture, and pollution from a number of agricultural, industrial, and domestic sources. In addition, invasive livebearing fishes may represent a significant threat to this endemic species. Given a limited range and several locally pervasive threats, this species is inferred to occur in 6-10 threat-based locations. The direct impact of these threats are unknown, but continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred.
