{"name": "118037631", "result": [{"species_id": 118037631, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is listed as Vulnerable, in view of its extent of occurrence (EOO) of 10,525 km<sup>2</sup> and area of occupancy (AOO) of 48 km<sup>2</sup>, with all observed individuals in six threat-based locations, and a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat related to deforestation and pollution from illegal mining activities.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from the Guiana Shield. It has been collected in the Aro River and also in the upper Caura Basin, in the Erebato, Kakada and Suajadito rivers, and in the main channel of the Caura.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate a population size, although this species occurs in high densities in small patches in the littorals of rivers.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It inhabits margins of streams with rocky and sandy bottoms in acidic waters tainted with tannins (Willink<em> et al. </em>2003).", "threats": "The main threat comes from gold mining of the tropical forests that cover the distribution area of this species&#160;(Oliveira-Miranda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). The Chorro Macho gold mine (Sanchez 2015) is in the distribution area of the population in the Aro River. The gold mines of the upper Yuruan\u00ed are 26 km upstream from the distribution area of the population in the Caura River. Therefore, this species is likely to be going through habitat loss and degradation.", "conservationmeasures": "Approximately half of the distribution area of this species falls within the newly created national park that encompasses the basin of the Caura River, but clearly there is a need for improved habitat protection at sites where it is known to occur.", "usetrade": "This species is collected and traded as an ornamental fish (Lasso 2005), however, there are no records about harvest rates, areas of collections, fishing methods, or average lengths of capture. The trade of this species is not regulated by any law."}]}
