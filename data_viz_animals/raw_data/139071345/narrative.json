The species occurs in at least one protected area: the Nanling National Nature Reserve. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to at least some degree due to loss of forest and other changes to habitat within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2. The species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1b(ii,iii)). It is to be hoped that when more data are available that reassessment to a lower threat category might be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Planaeschna nankunshanensis</em> is known from three locations in Guangdong in China (Zhang 2019, Zhang <em>et al. </em>2010). The species occurs in at least one protected area: the Nanling National Nature Reserve. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining to at least some degree due to loss of forest and other changes to habitat within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO), based on known collection data, is only 135 km\u00b2; its maximum EOO, based on occupied HydroBASINS areas, is 15,131 km\u00b2; its true EOO is likely smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2.<br/></p>", "population": "<p>This does not appear to be a common species. Even at Nankunshan where the largest populations have been observed the species is less common than other members of the Aeshnidae present. At least some ongoing decline in overall population is suspcted from loss of suitable lowland habitat in southern China.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species is found at both shady and exposed streams on mountains between 300\u20131,000m asl, and appears to be at least partly forest-dependent. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining to at least some degree due to loss of forest and other changes to habitat within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>Clearance of forest for farming will certainly be a threat to this species, as will diversion of streams to feed medium scale hydroelectric projects. Development of accommodation and other facilities for visitors is a definite threat at Nankunshan which is an increasingly popular holiday location.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More data on the distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance of this species are needed as well as the protection of additional habitat where it occurs.&#160;Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
