{"name": "139406606", "result": [{"species_id": 139406606, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Onychothemis abnormis</em> is a poorly known species, with records from Java and Sumatra in Indonesia and the Philippines. Records from Java are old (more than 100 years) and without specific locations, the assessor has only seen a single record (also from more than 100 years ago) from the north of Sumatra. It is not known if the species is still extant in Indonesia. The only remotely recent records are from the Philippines. The species is recorded from at least one protected area (the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park in Luzon). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible, but with the available data it is not likely to be large (quite possibly smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2). However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, due to loss of forest and other alterations to habitat within the range of the species. Its known extent of occurrence (EOO) (excluding the possibly extinct range in Indonesia) is much larger than the criterion B1 thresholds. Despite its large EOO, this appears to be a very scarce (although possibly under-recorded) species, for which there is some cause for concern. If its AOO was confirmed to be smaller than 2,000 km\u00b2, with the 13 current known locations (excluding Indonesia) and continuing decline, the species would be close to qualifying for Vulnerable status under criterion B. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B2ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Onychothemis abnormis</em> is a poorly known species with records from Java and Sumatra (Lieftinck 1935) in Indonesia and the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen pers. comm. 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.

They patrol a specific portion of the rapids, especially at sites with dangling roots or vines. However, the Catanduanes population was observed on a slow flowing stream with pool sections.\u201d The species appears to be forest-dependent, but it is not clear how tolerant of disturbance it is.
