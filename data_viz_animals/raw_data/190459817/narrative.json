{"name": "190459817", "result": [{"species_id": 190459817, "taxonomicnotes": "Differences in morphological, ecological and behavioural traits suggest that the current five-species arrangement does not accurately reflect species diversity within <em>Kosciuscola</em> (Tatarnic <em>et al</em>. 2013, Umbers <em>et al. </em>2021). Molecular work has&#160;confirmed that&#160;<em>K. cognatus&#160;</em>as presently understood is paraphyletic with respect to&#160;<em>K. tasmanicus&#160;</em>(Umbers&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).&#160;The recent emergence of major threats from climate change and bushfire, combined with the narrow ranges of these taxa as now understood, is here considered sufficient to justify assessing the reduced species concept of&#160;<em>K. cognatus&#160;</em>pending formal publication of the forthcoming taxonomic revision, and to assess the undescribed congeners.<br/><br/>Further research may be needed to confirm that the name <em>Kosciuscola cognatus </em>is applicable to the species concept applied here, as two major clades exist within this complex (Umbers <em>et al.</em> 2021). Comparisons with the holotype are needed to determine the appropriate usage of this name. Range limits between the two clades of <em>K. cognatus&#160;</em>are unclear, but&#160;seem to be divided based on elevation with \u2018true\u2019 <em>K. cognatus</em> inhabiting lower elevation sites", "rationale": "This species is listed as Near Threatened on the basis that it is believed to have undergone a global population decline of greater than 20%, and potentially very close to 30%, during the 2019-2020 bushfire season, expected to include high mortality of eggs already laid before fires came through. The timeframe over which comparable fire events may recur is unclear, but such events are expected to become more frequent and this threat has therefore not ceased. Multiple additional threats have been identified, and although the impacts of most on this at least previously common, adaptable species are uncertain, it is likely to be at particular risk from the decline in winter snow cover expected as a result of climate change, which has the potential to reduce successful recruitment.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Australia, where it occurs from the Australian Capital Territory south through the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales and across the border in to eastern Victoria. It has been recorded from sea level up to 1,800 m asl.", "population": "This species is common within its range.&#160;Modelling based on overlaying fire maps on the species' range (National Environmental Science Program unpubl. data) estimates that 53% of suitable habitat within this species' extent of occurrence was impacted by fire, 38% of which was at high intensity. Mortality in mature adults and juveniles is thought likely to be at least 90% in areas subject to high intensity fire, and between 30 and 70-90% in areas of less intensive fire. On the assumption that this species occurs or occurred throughout the impacted area, this corresponds to a global decline resulting from this single event of at least 22.5%, and potentially nearly 30%.&#160;Estimates of mortality from fire in the egg stage are uncertain, but as eggs are laid in shallow soil (around 2 cm deep) it is expected to be high in areas subject to high-intensity fire. The post-fire population trend is unknown.<br/><br/>This species has limited dispersal ability, estimated as less than 100 m over an individual's lifetime, and recolonization of burned areas is unlikely to occur quickly once a subpopulation is destroyed, and this is likely to have been exacerbated in subpopulations affected by fire. The species is however common where it occurs and subpopulations are presumably large enough to be viable in the absence of outside pressures, and as such it is unclear whether the population is severely fragmented. It is unknown whether the species undergoes extreme fluctuations.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is a habitat generalist that occurs in open woodland (up to about 80% canopy cover), shrubland, heathland and sub-alpine meadows. Eggs are laid in shallow soil<span style=\"\">. Individuals can be found beneath logs or bark, on standing wood, and in vegetation or leaf litter. The adult lifespan is unlikely to exceed a few months, with eggs overwintering in the soil often beneath snow cover (at least at high elevations), and the generation time is less than a year.</span>", "threats": "Bushfires are an increasing threat to this species. Around 25% of its extent of occurrence, and 53% of suitable habitat in its range was impacted in the 2019-2020 bushfires, based on overlaying maps of fire impacted areas with the known rang<span style=\"\">e.&#160;Future bushfires, likely including those of comparable extent and intensity, are expected to become increasingly common in this area</span><span style=\"\">&#160;and the intensity and impacts exacerbated by increased desiccation resulting from climate change.

Fire management needs to be conducted in a way that is not detrimental to this species.", "usetrade": "There is no known use of or trade in this species."}]}
