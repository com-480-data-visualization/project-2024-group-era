The species is known from many individual sites grouped into isolated clusters; it also occurs in protected areas (for example, the Knuckles Forest Reserve and Victoria-Randenigala-Rantambe Sanctuary). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but it is very unlikely to be more than 500 km\u00b2. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest and other threats within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 5,456 km\u00b2 (based on a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around the known data points); its maximum EOO is 8,155 km\u00b2 (based on an MCP around the HydroBASINS known to be occupied by this species).<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"></span></p>", "population": "<p>An ongoing decline in overall population of this species is inferred from loss and degradation of forest and other threats within the range of the species and the overall population will already be severely fragmented.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>\u201cAs far as habitat and distribution is concerned, <em>P. secreta</em> sp. nov. is peculiar and distinct from its congeners in inhabiting much drier eastern parts of the island. Here the appropriate habitats, like smaller shaded streams and seepages along rivulets in forest or at least in a forested corridor, are rather scarce\u201d Bedjani\u010d <em>et al. </em>(2016: 42). The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are observed to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest and other threats within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The forest cover of Sri Lanka has decreased by half in the past 50 years and the future of the island\u2019s forests remains precarious. Although the trend of forest loss is less drastic recently, increasing human population pressure and forest clearance for infrastructure projects and agricultural expansion remain the main threats to rich endemic biodiversity of Sri Lanka. Habitat loss and encroachment are also caused by the destruction of buffer forest corridors along streams, river impoundment, water extraction for irrigation and consumption, soil erosion, siltation, over-use of agricultural chemicals and careless pollution of rivers and streams. These threats all actually or potentially affect <em>Platysticta secreta </em>and climate change may also be negatively impacting its habitats. Specifically on threats in this species Bedjani\u010d <em>et al. </em>(2016: 42) also state \u201cDespite the fact that eastern parts of Sri Lanka are far less densely populated, the rather dry climate results in high pressure on flowing water for irrigation and domestic use. Consequently, and due to its small range, this new endemic <em>Platysticta</em> is globally threatened, and its habitats deserve special conservation attention\u201d.</span></p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The following steps are needed for the affective conservation of this species and other Odonata endemic to Sri Lanka: </p>  <p>(1) Enforce and supplement existing conservation measures in protected areas. In many cases the protective legislation doesn\u2019t stop the gross destruction of the habitat with the consequent loss of species. Agricultural expansion in forest areas slowly but consistently encroaches important areas by the cutting of undergrowth and small scale logging. When vegetation is removed or damaged around streams and seeps, there are negative effects on many dragonfly species. </p>  <p>(2) Establish new protected areas in the central and southwestern part of Sri Lanka and enlarge existing ones. Several patches of rainforests or partly degraded areas with exceptionally rich fauna and flora are excluded from the current protected area network. The conservation focus should be on the wet zone and montane areas where the majority of the island\u2019s endemics are found. </p>  <p>(3) Enforce existing legislation and legislate additional protection for the smallest streams, rivulets and forest corridors in the wet zone. Streams, rivulets and forest corridors need legislation to prohibit the diversion of streams and clearcutting from the edges since this destroys the dragonfly habitats. Buffer zones of natural vegetation, especially around swamps and flowing waters, should be mandatory by legislation. </p>  <p>(4) Enforce measures to avoid siltation and unnatural flow regimes of running waters. Damming streams or piping springs should be minimized, especially in key dragonfly conservation areas. Water extraction for consumption and irrigation should be sustainable, taking into account the integrity of the habitat and its biodiversity. </p>  <p>(5) Minimize the chemical and organic pollution of water habitats. The impact of the over-use of various agricultural chemicals and insecticides in Sri Lanka is virtually unknown, but surely has a strong negative impact on species, including humans. </p>  <p>(6) Restore degraded areas in key locations. The natural potential for restoration is very high in partly degraded habitats, and a favourable conservation status can be restored in a relatively short time with simple measures. </p>  <p>(7) Conduct comprehensive odonatological faunistic work in protected areas of the central and southwestern part of the island, including regular monitoring as a subsequent step. The amount of much-needed new knowledge gathered in this way would be immense. Without this baseline information, specific conservation guidelines are hard to elaborate and effective conservation measures on the local level cannot be undertaken. </p>  <p>(8) Raise awareness on the threat status of the endemic dragonfly fauna of Sri Lanka among local scientists, students, nature tour guides and naturalists, as well as relevant nature conservation authorities and organisations, both locally and internationally.</p>  <p>(9) As voucher specimen are vital in confirming the identity of newly discovered populations and as additional research is required on threatened endemic dragonfly species, it is highly recommended supporting and encourage taxonomic and faunistic work as important conservation actions. A more convenient process of obtaining permits from a centralized permit issuing agency should be enforced in future.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
