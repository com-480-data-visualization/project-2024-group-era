The total range of this species is included within a protected area. However, agriculture and tourism occur in the immediate area and have the potential to negatively affect habitat quality. Additionally, an eruption event of Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa has the future potential to drive this species towards extinction within a very short period of time. Introduced predatory fish in both lagoons is resulting in an inferred and continuous decline in habitat quality and availability.
