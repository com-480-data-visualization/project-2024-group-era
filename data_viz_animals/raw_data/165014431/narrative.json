There are significant current and potential threats to Lake Nicaragua and north Caribbean river drainages in Costa Rica, including land-use change resulting from agricultural development, pollution from domestic and agricultural sources, potential interactions with non-native species, as well as the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. These threats are inferred to have resulted in a reduction in the quality of available habitat.
