{"name": "83150678", "result": [{"species_id": 83150678, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Teinobasis ponapensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the high mountain zone of a small Pacific nation. There is no detailed information about the species' ecology and habitat needs. Based on the small area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO), and on only one recent location where the species has been recorded, it is listed as Critically Endangered. There is an ongoing threat based on water extraction and deforestation as well as climate events, which might bring the species to the brink of extinction. Additionally pollution due to agricultural and domestic run off water are an ongoing threat to aquatic animals.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Pohnpei Island, Federal States of Micronesia (Paulson and Buden 2003).", "population": "There is insufficient information to assess the population size of this species. It is known by four males only (Lieftinck 1962, Paulson and Buden 2003).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is apparently a high mountain dweller as all records (including the holotype) were made from elevations above 600 m. More information is needed to assess the habitat preferences for this species. Paulson and Buden (2003) recorded this species only near moss- and fern-covered rocks at streams in rain/cloud forest, however no breeding or ovipositing behaviour was observed.", "threats": "This species appears to be a high habitat specialist restricted to high mountain areas. Deforestation, river deviation, and any type of even small habitat alteration will have a serious adverse effect on it.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures in place for this species. Detailed studies on population size, trend, habitat preferences and monitoring are recommended.", "usetrade": null}]}
