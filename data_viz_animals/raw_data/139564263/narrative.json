There are insufficient data on the distribution of the species and the threats that it faces, however based on the area of Balabac and the fact that not all habitat on the island will be suitable for the species, its Area of Occupancy (AOO) known is less than 500km<sup>2</sup> and is inferred, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to be suffering at least some ongoing decline due to logging and agricultural activities. Although (see Taxonomic Note) the species might be a junior synonym of <em>P. palawana</em> it should be treated as distinct until there is completely convincing evidence to the contrary. With only three known locations the species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and, taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, is assessed accordingly. </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Prodasineura poncei</em> is only known from Balabac in the Philippines (Villanueva &amp; Cahilog 2013). The assessor is aware of records from three locations but it has not been possible to assign separate coordinates to one of these for mapping purposes. An accurate estimate of the Area of Occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data but the area of Balabac is less than 600km<sup>2</sup> and since not all of the island will be suitable for this species it is safe to say that its known AOO is less than 500km<sup>2</sup>. At least some ongoing decline in AOO can be inferred as a result of logging and agricultural activities on Balabac.</p>", "population": "<p>Judging from the number of specimens in the type series this can be a common species where it occurs. Nothing else can be said with the available data except that some decline in overall population is inferred from loss of habitat on Balabac, however this decline may not be very severe.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Villanueva &amp; Cahilog (2013: 23-24) note that \u201cThis species prefers small partly shaded streams. Although a small population was encountered on the swamp where clear flowing water surface[d] from the ground\u201d. An ongoing decline in both extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred from logging and agricultural activities on Balabac.</p>", "threats": "<p>It is difficult to assess the threats faced by this species without further data but Villanueva &amp; Cahilog (2013) note that logging is occurring in the low lying parts of the island and complete removal of forest will certainly be a threat to this species. Some clearance of forest for agriculture is occurring as well. The severity of threat to this species cannot be reliably evaluated with the available data but with the currently available information there is cause for concern.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The first priority for this species is for more data on its distribution and exact habitat requirements and to determine (see Taxonomic Note) if it is really distinct from <em>P. palawana</em>. Protection of areas where the species occurs will also be needed. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
