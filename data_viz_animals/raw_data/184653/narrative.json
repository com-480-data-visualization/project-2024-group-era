{"name": "184653", "result": [{"species_id": 184653, "taxonomicnotes": "<em>Biomphalaria smithi </em>is considered as a distinct species, confined to Lake Edward (the mention of this species from Lake Chad is probably erroneous). It is analogous to <em>B. choanomphala choanomphala</em> of L Victoria and <em>B. stanleyi</em> of Lake Albert. It does not occur in the Lake Victoria Basin.", "rationale": "This species occurs in Lake Edward and the nearby Lake Mirambi Crater Lake. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is approximately 4,000 km\u00b2 and its area of occupancy (AOO) is approximately 1,000 km\u00b2. There is a declining quality of habitat as these shallow parts of&#160; Lake Edward are already disturbed by intensive boat traffic, sedimentation and pollution. Based on these threats and the areas of suitable habitat within the lakes, there are 10-20 locations. It is close to meeting the thresholds and conditions for criterion B1; therefore the species is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Edward, DRC and Uganda (2,203 km\u00b2) and Mirambi Crater Lake, Uganda (&lt;20 km\u00b2). It is not known from the Lake Victoria drainage.", "population": "The species is locally abundant in Lake Edward (D. Van Damme pers. comm. 2016).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is commonly found in vegetation or on sandy substrates up to four to&#160;ten metres depth.", "threats": "There is a declining quality of habitat due to agricultural and urban&#160;run-off and the increase of human settlements has greatly increased the use of motor boats for fishing and transport, destroying the fields of aquatic vegetation&#160;in which this species lives.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions exist for this species.", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
