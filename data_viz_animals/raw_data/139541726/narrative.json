Threats exist at all known locations and the overall population is believed to be severely fragmented. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is not likely to be large and is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of habitat across the range of the species. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely well below 20,000 km\u00b2. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly. When more data become available re-assessment to Endangered is as likely as re-assessment to Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Pandanobasis curacha</em> is known from seven locations in Homonhon and Samar in the Philippines (Villanueva 2012). It has also been recorded from singe locations in each of Biliran and Mindanao but as noted by Villanueva (2012) there are some differences in these populations, and they might represent a distinct species; these records are treated as presence uncertain here and are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence (EOO) below. It might be present in the Calbayog Pan-as\u2013Hayiban Protected Landscape in Samar which is not far from one of the known locations and is likely to be present in two (non-protected) Important Bird Areas (IBAs) on Samar, the Mount Cabalantian - Mount Capoto-an complex and the Mount Yacgun - Mount Sohoton complex and might be present within the Sohoton Natural Bridge Natural Park within the latter IBA. Additionally, the entirety of Samar is apparently a Natural Park but this does not seem to have any practical value. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is not likely to be large and is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of habitat across the range of the species. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) is somewhere between 7,836 and 21,325 km\u00b2 (based on the area within a minimum convex polygon around the known localities and around the occupied HydroBASIN areas).<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"></p>", "population": "<p>All that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss and degradation of forest throughout the range of the species and that severe fragmentation is highly likely for the same reasons.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Nothing was recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it will be forest dependent and is very likely to breed in phytotelmata. An ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss and degradation of forest throughout the range of the species.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species on Samar will be from loss of forest to agriculture or as a result of logging. For example, based on information compiled in 2001 BirdLife International (2019) state for the Mount Cabalantian - Mount Capoto-an complex Important Bird Area where this species might occur (underlining by the assessor): \u201cThere is presumably encroachment into the forests of this IBA by illegal occupants and the extraction of timber and other forest products, <u>as elsewhere on Samar</u>.\u201d There is no evidence that the situation has improved. On Homonhon the main threat appears to be from mining operations and very extensive deforestation has already occurred there.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More data on the distribution, habitat requirements, ability to tolerate disturbance and presence in existing protected areas is needed for this species and better protection for existing protected areas on Samar.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
