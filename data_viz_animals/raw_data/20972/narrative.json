This butterfly has not been seen for 32 years in areas close to Cape Town. Most of the previously known subpopulations have experienced significant habitat destruction and degradation. The type locality on the Tygerberg Hills, is now a massive quarry, with a north-south diameter of about 1 km. It is possibly extinct, and the window of relevance of conservation measures has probably passed. However, continued searching for possible further subpopulations is still required before this taxon is listed as Extinct. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "Endemic to the Western Cape Province in South Africa, this species occurs on low hills south of Darling and near Malmesbury, and used to occur on the Tygerberg Hills, near Cape Town in the south.", "population": "Last seen in 1985.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species' habitat is renosterveld type fynbos, preferentially on the western and southern slopes of low hills.", "threats": "Habitat degradation and fragmentation due to farming, invasive plants, housing and mining are all major threats. Mining has resulted in loss of the type locality. Possible climate change impacts could also affect vegetation required by the species. This butterfly has not been seen since 1985 and is probably extinct.", "conservationmeasures": "Surveys to determine the presence of any other subpopulations are required. Adults of this taxon have not been seen for just over three decades.", "usetrade": null}]}
