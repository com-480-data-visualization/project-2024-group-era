Area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is assigned to a single threat-based location. Total population size and population trend are unknown, but the species is known from a very limited number of individuals. The primary threat to this species is declining habitat quality and potential future habitat destruction associated with deforestation and urbanization. Therefore, <em>M. impertatrizensis</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). Future research regarding distribution, population size, population trend, and the direct impact of localized threats will be necessary to clarify the conservation status of this species.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Melanorivlus imperatrizensis</em><strong> </strong>is known only from its type locality, a small headwater spring in the urban area of the small village Bananal, near the middle Tocantins River channel, Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil (Nielsen and Pinto 2015).</p>  <p>Area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup> based on a single 2x2 km grid overlain on top of the type locality.
