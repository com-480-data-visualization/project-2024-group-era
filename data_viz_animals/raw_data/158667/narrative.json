It might be more widely spread than its known distribution, but as long as we do not know more about its real distribution and its sensitivity, it should be listed in a threat category. Observations show, that populations can have large numbers, but there seem to be fluctuations in population and individual numbers. However, the species is assessed as Near Threatened, as only a dozen localities are known and it has a small range.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Grande Terre Island, New Caledonia (Grand <em>et al</em>. 2014).", "population": "No details are known on the population size or trends of this species. It was reported from more than ten localities mainly from the southern part of Grande Terre Island, but number of mature individuals seem to fluctuate extremely.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Mountain creeks and streams in forests, but also in large streams of the lowlands, with strong current. <em>Synthemis campioni</em> avoids ultramafic lands.&#160;Naiads develop in relatively calm waters of banks where roots of large trees are partly submerged. Exuviae are found on trunks and boulders 0.2-1.4 m above the water surface. Males patrol a stretch of a bank (6-30 m). Mating (two observations) occurs during flight, between 0.7 m and 1.2 m above the water surface, for 20-30 s, along the stretch of banks which was patrolled by the male.", "threats": "No information is available on the threats to this species, but ongoing habitat destruction and alteration are assumed to be an ongoing threat.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no known conservation measures in place.
