Increasing temperatures and droughts have brought about this situation.", "conservationmeasures": "It is recommended that the subpopulations are monitored for any changes in the habitat and that an appropriate fire regime be instituted.&#160;Research is needed into its life history, ecology/habitat requirements, and monitoring of known subpopulations is recommended to determine the population size and trends.", "usetrade": null}]}
