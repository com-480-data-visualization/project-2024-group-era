{"name": "212528279", "result": [{"species_id": 212528279, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Europe, where it is currently known from only one spring in Sidironero, north of Drama, in northeastern Greece. It occurs in one location and exhibits a preference for a habitat that is severely at risk from human activities, such as water abstraction, and from drought and temperature extremes driven by climatic change. These threats could plausibly push the species into Critically Endangered or Extinct very quickly. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable (VU D2).", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from one spring in Sidironero, north of Drama (Glo\u00ebr <em>et al</em>. 2018) in northeastern Greece, in the Rhodope Mountains region.", "population": "No population data (size and trend) are available for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This is an aquatic snail, found on decaying leaves in the spring.", "threats": "Its habitat is severely at risk from human activities, such as water abstraction, and from the effects of climate change, especially temperature extremes.
