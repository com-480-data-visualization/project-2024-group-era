{"name": "124556154", "result": [{"species_id": 124556154, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it is restricted to a single and small section of Likoma Island. It is an uncommon cichlid and vulnerable to extirpation due to overfishing by the ornamental fish trade. The species has a very restricted range (with an extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) both of 4 km<sup>2</sup>) at a single location where it is threatened by collection of the ornamental trade and potentially by sedimentation. The population is declining and so this species is assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where&#160;it is only known from Membe Point and Maingano Island along the northeastern shore of Likoma Island.", "population": "This is an uncommon species.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "It inhabits the sediment-rich intermediate habitat of rock reefs between 15 and 30 m depth in areas where rocks are small. Males feed from aufwuchs on the rocks and additionally feed on plankton, but usually do not venture more than about 40 cm away from the substrate. Females and juveniles mostly feed on plankton. Food consists mainly of diatoms and small strands of cyanobacteria which are combed from the algal matrix. Males hold territories among small rocks and sometimes alongside a single rock in the sand, several metres away from other rocks. In many territories spawning sites are dug alongside or beneath the rocks. Females are not territorial and are usually solitary.", "threats": "Extraction by the ornamental fish trade and sedimentation are threats.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are in place.", "usetrade": "It is regularly collected by the ornamental fish trade where it is known as \"Membe Deep\"."}]}
