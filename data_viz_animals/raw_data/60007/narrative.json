Unfortunately we do not have any information on the species habitat, which is most likely the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika. If this is true indeed, the species is most likely much more widespread around the lake, threatened by pollution and a destruction of the shoreline.<br/>Even though the small number of locations and hence the low AOO, we assume a much wider distribution. The entire area is undersurveyed and we assume, that more surveys would reveal much more localities of P. pinheyi in Zambia, Tanzania and DRC.", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from the shores of Lake Tanganyika (Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia).", "population": "Population size is unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Likely to breed in streams or rivers, and perhaps endemic to the mountains around Lake Tanganyika; likely to be a forest species rather than a lake species, but there is limited information.", "threats": "The whole border region of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo has been subject to extreme population pressure. The environment and wildlife in that area has suffered tremendously. Though dragonflies are not directly exploited by locals, the effects of deforestation and water pollution are immense and can be inferred for the range area of this species.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures known but research into population numbers and range, biology and ecology, habitat status, threats, and trends/monitoring would be valuable.", "usetrade": null}]}
