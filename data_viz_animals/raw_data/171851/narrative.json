{"name": "171851", "result": [{"species_id": 171851, "taxonomicnotes": "<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span>", "rationale": "This species is known from only a few specimens, being restricted to a single location with a very small extent of occurrence (around 1 km<sup>2</sup>) in a region that has been highly modified by agricultural practices. Collecting efforts focused on recovering specimens of <em>M. siamensis</em> in 2015, 2016, and 2017 were unsuccessful (Pfeiffer, pers. obs, 2017). Therefore, it qualifies for Critically Endangered B1ab(i,ii)+2ab(i,ii). Given that the last records of living animals were in 1974, it is possible that this species is already extinct. <br/><br/><p><br/></p>", "geographicrange": "The exact distribution of this species is unclear. In the original description by Brandt (1974) he described the distribution as \u201cMiddle reaches of the Mun River\u201d, but it appears to be known only from the type locality. Despite the Mun River being one of the most well surveyed rivers in Thailand, the species has not been found outside of its type locality (John Pfeiffer, pers. obs., 2017).", "population": "There is no information on population but it may be very localized because its habitat requirements are very specific.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "The species lives in hard clay substrates of the river (Brandt, 1974).", "threats": "Threats in the area that may be affecting the species are habitat degradation associated with agriculture practices, water pollution, damming and increasing siltation.", "conservationmeasures": "Conservation measures in the area are unknown. Site protection is recommended as well as research.", "usetrade": "The species is not used."}]}
