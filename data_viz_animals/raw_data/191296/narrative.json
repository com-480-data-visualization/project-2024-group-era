There is continuing decline in the quality of its habitat due to pollution from pesticides and herbicides and sedimentation. It is therefore listed as Endangered. <em><br/></em>", "geographicrange": "<p>This species is endemic to Mexico, where it occurs in the R\u00edo Ojo Fr\u00edo (R\u00edo Gallinas basin) above a 105 m falls in San Luis Potos\u00ed (Miller <em>et al. </em>2005). The extent of occurrence is estimated at 1,700 km<sup>2</sup> and it occurs in one location, based on the main threats affecting its population. <br/></p>", "population": "Miller <em>et al</em>. (2005) points out that it was not found in the collections of R. L Mayden in 1990, and Mayden <em>et al</em>. (1992) consider it an endangered species. Recent surveys (2013-2015) recorded the species in Rio Ojo Frio (F. Perez-Miranda pers. comm. 2018).&#160; Observations in this river suggest that the species is common (F.

Temperatures vary from 22\u00b0 to 26\u00b0C in March and May; elevations 450-460 m Asl; breeding males and females were collected in March and May, indicating a springtime reproductive season (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p>", "threats": "The main threats to the species are pesticides and fertilizers used in sugar cane agriculture, increased run-off and sedimentation (Arriaga-Cabrera <em>et al</em>. 1998).", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions for <em>Tampichthys rasconis</em> are known. It is not present in protected areas. Research is needed to better determine the distribution, population size and trends and the threats that may be affecting it. <br/><br/>It is listed as Endangered, Criteria 1,5 by the U.S Geographical survey (http://fisc.er.usgs.gov/afs/) (Jelks,<em> et al</em>.  2008). Criteria 1 implies: present or threatened destruction,  modification, or reduction of a taxon's habitat or range, including  perturbations caused by factors such as sedimentation, chemical  pollution, dewatering, and anthropogenic modifications to natural  channels or flow regimes. Criteria 5 implies: a narrowly restricted  range. The sources relevant to the supposed threats faced by this  species in U.S Geographical survey however, cannot be located.", "usetrade": "This species is not used or traded."}]}
