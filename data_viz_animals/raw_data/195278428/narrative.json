{"name": "195278428", "result": [{"species_id": 195278428, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine polyplacophoran&#160;is restricted to hydrothermal vents on seamounts in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from two restricted locations, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 400 m bsl to 460 m bsl, and would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if commercial deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. The potential for anthropogenic influence to this species based on exploration licences for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites in one of the two locations supports a potential projected continuing decline in quality of habitat. There may already be disturbance to this species as Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) is in the process of testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing. However, the majority of the known population has been observed at two seamounts in one location in the Northern Marianas Islands, which are explicitly protected from mining by the Mariana Arc of Fire National Wildlife Refuge and the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument Volcanic Unit&#160;(USA). Therefore, owing to the significant protection provided by these MPAs and the resulting variability in extinction risk for the different populations, we have opted to assess the species as Near Threatened (NT). The species is close to qualifying for a threatened category based on the potential threat of mining activity in a subset of locations where the species occurs. As such, the assessment as NT is dependent on the maintenance of the current marine protection within the USA EEZ vent fields. A reassessment would therefore be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of the MPAs, whereby the species would become Endangeed (EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)), based on the projected continuing decline in habitat associated with the location in mining licence areas.", "geographicrange": "<p>This deep-sea polyplacophoran is restricted to two locations at hydrothermal vents on seamounts in the West Pacific. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.&#160;</p><p>The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 400 m bsl to 460 m bsl. It has been observed from vent fields on three seamounts in two locations (Saito <em>et al</em>. 2008). One location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the second location lies within the EEZ of Japan.&#160;Location 1 includes the&#160;Kasuga II Seamount and&#160;Daikoku Seamount, which are explicitly protected within the Mariana Arc of Fire National Wildlife Refuge and the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument Volcanic Unit&#160;(USA). Location 2 is a vent field on the&#160;Nikko Seamount which is within the EEZ of Japan.&#160;The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.</p>", "population": "<p>These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Saito <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on seamounts in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 400 m bsl to 460 m bsl.", "threats": "One of the two vent field locations that comprise the known habitat of this species lies within the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone and are not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018). The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) has developed test mining equipment, which targets seafloor massive sulphides and is in the process of conducting verification tests (Shirayama&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Polymetallic sulphide resource exploration can include some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation phases, hence there may already be disturbance of the subpopulation. As well as direct impacts, evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. We therefore consider the current exploratory mining and the likelihood of future exploitative mining licences within the Japan EEZ to be a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "One of the two locations where this species is known includes two seamounts within the EEZ of the Northern Marianas Islands; these areas are are explicitly protected by the the Mariana Arc of Fire National Wildlife Refuge (USA) and the Marianas Trench Volcanic Unit Marine National Monument (USA).&#160;&#160;The vent fields within the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument form the Volcanic Unit, also know as the Mariana Arc of Fire National Wildlife Refuge (Bush 2009). The area is managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Minerals Management Policy of USFWS forbids mineral extraction on NWRS lands, including seabed (US Fish and Wildlife 2016).<br/>Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along West Pacific Ocean ridges.", "usetrade": "<p>There is no known trade or use of this species.</p>"}]}
