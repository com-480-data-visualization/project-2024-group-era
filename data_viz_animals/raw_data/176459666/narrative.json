The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 3,196 km<sup>2</sup>. Major threats are habitat degradation by the construction of dams and the introduction of invasive exotic species. There is a single location based on these threats. At present, it is unknown as to whether the threats are causing continuing declines. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This is an endemic species that occurs only in one tributary to the Paran\u00e1 River Basin, the Arroyo Urugua-\u00ed in Provincia Misiones, Argentina (Casciotta <em>et al. </em>2000, Malabarba<em> et al.</em> 2015).", "population": "The population documentation is null.

Despite being a common species throughout the Arroyo Urugua-\u00ed Basin in all types of habitats, including modified habitats, major threats are habitat degradation by the construction of dams and the introduction of invasive exotic species, such as tilapias, as reported in other congeners inhabiting dam areas (Casciotta <em>et al</em>. 2017).", "conservationmeasures": "There is no research or monitoring known to be conducted for this species.
