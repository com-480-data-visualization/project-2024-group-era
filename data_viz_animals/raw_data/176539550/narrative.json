The clear water stream ranges between 1\u20131.5 m in width and 0.15\u20130.50 m in depth, and runs over clay and rock\u2010pebble substrata with algae. This area has geothermal activity. At the spring source, the water emerges at 50 to 60\u00b0 C into a small pool, which drains&#160;400 m away from the source into the stream where water temperature cools down to 37\u00b0 C. The species occurs mainly in the area where the water is 37\u00b0 C and has a pH of 8.2. Based on three specimens analysed, the diet consists mainly of Diptera (mostly Chironomidae) and Coleoptera (Elmidae) (Fernandez and Miranda 2007).", "threats": "<a>It is presumed to be affected by water reduction for </a><a>human recreation in pools</a>, contamination by detergents, and climate change.", "conservationmeasures": "This species is not present in any protected areas.", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
