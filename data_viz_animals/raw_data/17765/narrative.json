A population decline has been observed as a result of overfishing and introduced invasive alien species (Rainbow trout). With an AOO of less than 1 km<sup>2</sup> and one location, the species is assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Poblana squamata</em>&#160;is known to occur within Lago de Quechulac, Puebla, Mexico (D\u00edaz-Pardo and Mendoza-Vallejo 2016).", "population": "The average maximum size of this species has decreased as a result of the increase in the number of fishermen (D\u00edaz-Pardo and Mendoza-Vallejo 2016). More information is needed about the population size and population trend of <em>Poblana squamata</em>.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "Quechulac is an axalapasco or lake-crater, whose major axis barely exceeds 1000 m in length and is 39 m deep. Given the strong slope of the edges there is emergent aquatic vegetation in only some parts of the axalapasco, represented by ciper\u00e1ceas; these are the sites preferred by this species. The absence of human settlements on the edges or inside the crater has propitiated that the lacustrine body maintains good quality conditions: the only use of water is for domestic work and for the cultivation of exotic fish. The crater lake is a body of clear and relatively cold waters. Throughout an annual cycle the transparency ranges from 2 to 6 m, the temperature from 15 to 19 \u00b0 C, the dissolved oxygen varies from 7 to 8.5 mg/l, the hardness from 37 to 55 mg/l, the pH of 7.7 to 9.1, sulphates of 14 to 24 mg/l, phosphates 0.01 to 0.9 and nitrates of 0.9 to 2.2 mg/L (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992).

In addition, there is a risk of the escape of trout (<em>Onchorynchus mykiss</em>) from the enclosures present in the lake (D\u00edaz-Pardo and Mendoza-Vallejo 2016) and desiccation due to over extraction of water resources and climate change.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is listed as threatened in the SEMARNAT (2010).
