Although the species is known from a relatively large number of sites, including within protected areas, threats exist at all locations. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it may not be large, probably not significantly greater than 2,000km<sup>2</sup> and likely less than 2,000km<sup>2</sup>, and will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of and disturbance to forest throughout the range of the species and including within protected areas. The overall population is believed to be declining and to be severely fragmented. The species is close to qualifying for Vulnerable status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and would qualify if its AOO was definitely known to be below 2,000km<sup>2</sup> and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rhinocypha sanguinolenta</em> is known only from Mindanao in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.

The assessor is aware of records from at least 25 sites but it has not proved possible to assign separate coordinates to all of these for mapping purposes. The species is present in a number of protected areas, for instance the Mount Apo, Mount Kitanglad Range and Mount Kalatungan Natural Parks. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it may not be large, probably not significantly greater than 2,000km<sup>2</sup> and likely less than 2,000km<sup>2</sup>, and will be declining due to loss of and disturbance to forest throughout the range of the species and including within protected areas.</p>", "population": "<p>This species does not appear to be particularly common even where it occurs. Beyond this all that can be said with the available information is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of and disturbance to forest within the range of the species and that the overall population will already be severely fragmented.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Little has been recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it will be a species of forest streams. Although it has been recorded as low as 100-200m a.s.l., most records are from higher altitude (above 800m a.s.l.) suggesting that it prefers montane forest, however since in the areas where the species occurs little forest remains below 800m a.s.l. the apparent altitude preference might actually be the result of strong dependence on forest. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for this species are declining due to loss of and disturbance to forest, including within protected areas.</p>", "threats": "<p>Threats to this species are from clearance of forest, especially montane forest, through logging or for agriculture. These threats extend to the protected areas where the species occurs, for instance for the Mount Kitanglad Range Natural Park BirdLife International (2019, but based on data from 2001) state that \u201cThe human activities most severely impacting the protected area are high value crop plantations, kaingin, small-scale logging and establishment of buildings and roads for telecommunications and military camps. There are lower intensity impacts from gathering of non-yimber forest products, tourism, hunting, fishing and grazing. Unfortunately, government programmes promoting plantation agriculture and forestry are providing encouragement to communities to encroach into the protected area and its buffer zone. Further, the lack of security of tenure over the land by local communities has created an open access situation; it is a disincentive to investing in more sustainable agricultural practices and leaves local communities powerless when trying to keep people from expanding agriculture into the forest areas. On the southern slope of Mt Kitanglad, especially in the Lantapan and Basak areas, vegetable farming techniques (the \u201cgardening technology\u201d) have been brought in by migrant Igorots from Luzon\u2019s Mountain Province. Large tracts of montane forest have been cleared for this by burning and then planted to cultivars that do not thrive in the lowlands, including cabbage, potato, radish and carrots. Fires that spread into the forests from adjacent grasslands are also a problem. Overhunting and commercial collecting of wildlife are widespread. Vast agricultural plantations have been established, such as a Dole pineapple plantation. These have displaced local farmers, who have destroyed secondary forests for farming, and fires started to burn areas of forest have gone out of control.\u201d</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More data on the distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance of this species are required, and the prevention of encroachment into the existing protected areas where it occurs.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
