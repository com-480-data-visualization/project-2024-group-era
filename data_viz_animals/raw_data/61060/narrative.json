{"name": "61060", "result": [{"species_id": 61060, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species has a restricted range being only recorded between Mdoka and Chitande Island in Lake Malawi.&#160;It meets the area requirements under criterion B for the threatened categories and, based on the threat of over-exploitation by the aquarium trade, it is known from one location. However, continuing declines in population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of aquarium trade on this species are unknown and it is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi, where it has only been recorded from the northwestern shore between Mdoka and Chitande Island.", "population": "There is no information available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is found over the sand in intermediate habitats where rocks are lying on the sand. Territorial males are only observed at depths greater than about 15 m, whereas foraging females and non-breeding males can be found at a depth of three metres only. Food consists of small crustaceans and insect larvae, which are collected from the sand. Territorial males, which are found throughout the year, defend their premises only against conspecifics. Spawning takes place inside the cave or sometimes on the open sand if the male was unsuccessful in obtaining a cave. Ripe females approach the males' territories, which are situated at rather deep levels.", "threats": "This species is extracted by the aquarium trade.", "conservationmeasures": "No information is available on conservation actions in place. Site protection and monitoring of the population trend are recommended.", "usetrade": "This species is regularly collected by the ornamental fish trade where it is sometimes known as \"Northern&#160;Aulonocara\"&#160;or as \"Chitande&#160;Aulonocara\"."}]}
