The species should also be looked for in Myanmar. Although this species appears to be common where it occurs, it is also forest-dependent. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but it may be small. However, the AOO, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, is inferred to be declining to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its current known extent of occurrence (EOO) is smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2. Given the relatively small area that the species is known from, the small number of known locations and the fact that the species is forest-dependent, and taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, it is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iii). It is to be hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Lamelligomphus annakarlorum</em> is only known from Xishuangbanna in Yunnan, China, including from the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2016).
