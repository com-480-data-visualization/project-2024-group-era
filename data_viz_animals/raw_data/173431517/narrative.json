It is known from two locations in the province and has an extent of occurrence and an area of occupancy of 8 km\u00b2. Although the species is known from a restricted area, it is likely to be under collected and one or two more locations are suspected to occur. There is ongoing decline of its grassland habitat due to crop cultivation, forestry plantations and urban development. Due to the species having a small restricted distribution range (&lt; 100 km<sup>2</sup>) and occurring at fewer than five locations it is listed as Endangered B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii).", "geographicrange": "The species is found in South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal and occurs between Pietermaritzburg and Hilton.", "population": "There is currently no population information about the species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The spider constructs a bolas-line consisting of two to three silk threads, with two to three sticky droplets at the free end. The spider uses the second pair of legs to whirl the bolas-line. Whirling is done at short, erratic intervals of two to five minutes. The spider makes its retreat in a plant about 1.8 m above the soil surface. The species is found in vegetation in the Sub-Escarpment Savanna, but in some cases may be able to survive in suburban gardens. The spider constructs a bolas line used to catch moths at night.", "threats": "This species has lost habitat to forest plantations, crop cultivation and urban development.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is currently not recorded to be under protection.", "usetrade": null}]}
