It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,916 km<sup>2</sup>. Modifications caused by land use change, urbanization, road  construction, and for irrigation in agriculture are the main threats to  this species. There is a single location and a projected reduction in the area of occupancy (AOO)  and habitat due to land use change and channelization of swampy areas.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in R\u00edo Guyraugu\u00e1, tributary to the Monday River in Paraguay (Lucinda<em> et al.</em> 2005).", "population": "The population documentation is null. Research and monitoring is needed to know population composition, structure, size and trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in slow flowing streams and swampy areas near streams, with submerged vegetation (Meyer and Etzel 2006).", "threats": "The distribution is located near a main road in Paraguay and also in a region of importance for agriculture and the cattle sector. Modifications caused by land use change, urbanization, road construction, and for irrigation in agriculture are the main threats to this species. The impact of these threats to the species are unknown. However, there is a projected reduction in the area of occupancy (AOO) due to land use change and channelization of swampy areas.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no research, monitoring and planning known to be conducted for this species. Research is necessary in population, ecology, conservation and threats.", "usetrade": "This species is used in the aquarium trade."}]}
