Threats exist throughout Cebu and severe fragmentation appears certain due to deforestation on the island An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, however loss of forest has been so severe on Cebu that it is unlikely that the AOO of the species exceeds 50 km\u00b2; it could be much smaller. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. Its known extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely smaller than 100 km\u00b2. Therefore, this species qualifies for Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(ii,iii); it is also close to meeting CR B2ab(ii,iii). </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta sugbo</em> is only known from three non-protected locations in Cebu in the Philippines (Villanueva and Seidenschwarz 2012).
