{"name": "176403591", "result": [{"species_id": 176403591, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species occurs in the north-western part of La Plata river basin, Argentina and upper Madeira river basin, Bolivia. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 19,042 km<sup>2</sup>. The main threat is water abstraction for  irrigation by neighbouring farms. There are 2-3 locations based on this threat. However, it is unclear whether this is leading to a continuing decline in the habitat. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "The distribution falls within the north-western part of La Plata river basin, Argentina and upper Madeira river basin, Bolivia (Vari <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ferraris 2007).<br/><br/>This species was captured in the Pescado River (Bermejo River basin), close to Oran, Salta Province, Argentina under the bridge of the Ruta Nacional N\u00b0 50, 350 meters above sea level, Bermejo River basin (Aguilera and Mirande 2006). This species is found in the Great River ichthyological province<em> </em>of Argentina (L\u00f3pez<em> et al.</em> 2008) and inhabits the Regi\u00f3n Humedales Montanos Precordilleranos y Subandinos<em> </em>of the Argentine wetlands classification (Benzaquen <em>et al.</em> 2017).", "population": "No quantitative information on the population size or trend is available, thus it is not possible to identify if the species is common, abundant, rare, etc.&#160;Since the species has not been identified as having economic or conservation value, no studies have been devoted to assessing its trends and status.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The Pescado River is highly seasonal with very low flow during dry season and very high flow during the rainy season with a wide channel. At the collecting site, the river has a maximum depth of one metre with a sandy bottom, and fast-flowing, moderately turbid water, which has a very variable flow regime (Aguilera and Mirande 2006). Individuals inhabit a mix of rocky and sandy bottoms in a meandriform river with several secondary branches.", "threats": "The main threat is that water of the Pescado River is used for irrigation by neighbouring farms.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions in place or recommended actions. A large area of the Pescado River basin corresponds to a national park.", "usetrade": "There is no use or trade information for this species."}]}
