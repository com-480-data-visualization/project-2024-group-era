It is known from a limited number of museum records and collection localities, and appears to be highly restricted. Deforestation for unsustainable agriculture, livestock production, and pollution from agricultural activities have the potential to drastically increase the extinction risk of this species within the immediate future. However, their currents impacts on population status and habitat quality have not been evaluated in detail.
