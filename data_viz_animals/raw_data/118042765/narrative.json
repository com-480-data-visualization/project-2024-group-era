{"name": "118042765", "result": [{"species_id": 118042765, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,412 km<sup>2</sup> and the area of occupancy (AOO) of 20 km<sup>2</sup> are restricted. There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat related to cattle ranch farming and agriculture. However, there is insufficient information to count locations. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened. The entire range of this species is within a national park, which might reduce risks to this species in the mid-term if appropriate conservation measures are taken.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from the Kuquenan and Yuruani rivers in the Guiana Shield, in Bol\u00edvar state.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate the population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It inhabits rapids with swift currents and rocky substrates (Armbruster and Taphorn 2013).", "threats": "The main threat is habitat loss and degradation. Around 30% of its distribution area is tropical forests that are under threat because of log extraction, fires and deforestation due to the settlement of farms (Oliveira-Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010). The Yuruan\u00ed River's integrity is being affected by the presence of illegal gold mines.", "conservationmeasures": "The entire known population occurs within Canaima National Park. However, there is at least one illegal gold mine within the park that is near the  limits of this species, and this suggests that this measure alone  might not suffice to guarantee its conservation. There is little information available about its range, ecology and population trends.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded in the ornamental fish market or if it is part of the livelihoods of indigenous peoples."}]}
