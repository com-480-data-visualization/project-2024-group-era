Despite existing protections in Darien National Park, illegal logging activities continue to result in deforestation and habitat degradation (Mateo-Vega <em>et al</em>. 2019, Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2019). Deforestation and associated habitat loss due primarily to agricultural expansion occurs along the InterAmerican Highway transportation corridor to its terminus at Yaviza (Cano <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>These threats are likely to be producing inferred continuous declines in aquatic habitat quality and availability, given the impact of deforestation on natural flow hydrology and sedimentation.

However, the range of this species extends partially into Darien National Park (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2019), which may afford indirect protections against habitat degradation.
