{"name": "212528528", "result": [{"species_id": 212528528, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Greece, where it is known from a single locality: a spring near Tempi. It occurs in just one location, with a very small extent of occurrence and area of occupancy (both around 4 km\u00b2). The species exhibits preference to a habitat that is severely at risk from water abstraction, pollution, and drought and temperature extremes driven by climate change. The spring occurs in an area that is not well maintained, and its habitat is likely to be undergoing continuing decline in quality. Therefore, this species is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B (CR B1ab(ii)+2ab(iii)).", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Greece, where it is known from a single locality: a spring near Tempi (Boeters <em>et al</em>. 2018), Larissa, in the Central Greece Region.", "population": "No population data (size or trends) are available for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This aquatic snail was found in a freshwater spring system. The surrounding area is not well maintained, with lots of debris around. The habitat is likely to be undergoing continuing decline in quality due to lack of maintenance and pollution from the nearby road.", "threats": "Its habitat is severely at risk from human activities, such as water abstraction and pollution, and from the effects of climate changes, especially temperature extremes. The species is known only from a single location, which is close to a major road (risking run-off from the road into the spring), and the area immediately surrounding the spring is not well maintained.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are in effect for the species.", "usetrade": "Species is not used or traded."}]}
