Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 18,890 km<sup>2</sup>. Total population size and population trend are unknown. However, mining activities, land-use changes and agricultural expansion along major transportation corridors, and deforestation associated with these activities is producing a continuous inferred decline in habitat quality throughout much of the species range. Given uncertainties regarding species distribution, and the scope and magnitude of major pervasive threats, the number of locations where this species occurs cannot be determined. Therefore, <em>D. latiura </em>is assessed as Near Threatened because it nearly reaches the threshold for classification under a threatened category using criterion B1ab(iii).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Dasyloricaria latiura</em>&#160;is distributed from the Bayano River drainage to the Tuira River drainage on the Pacific slope of eastern Panama (Pineda 1976), and in the Atrato River drainage on the Atlantic slope of Colombia (Reis <em>et al</em>. 2003, Smith and Bermingham 2005, Maldonado-Ocampo <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2012, Covain <em>et al</em>. 2016). The type locality of this species is Boca de Certegai, Colombia (Reis <em>et al</em>. 2003). This species does not occur in Pacific slope drainages of Colombia (Donascimiento <em>et al</em>. 2017), nor has it been recorded from Atlantic slope drainages in Panama (Breder 1927).</p>  Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 18,890 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2019).
