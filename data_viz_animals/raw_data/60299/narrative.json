{"name": "60299", "result": [{"species_id": 60299, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The Angola Sparklewing has only been recorded at 4 locations, which are spread over the range of the Planalto do Bi\u00e9 and the neighbouring Serra da Chela. The species seems to be restricted to these mountain ranges. All records are old (1932, 1933, 1951, 1973) and outside protected area. Three of the four old localities has not been surveyed since. From Tundavala we have few recent records. Hence the species seems present and might be more widespread. The current area of Occupancy is 16 km\u00b2 and the Extent of occurrence 60,931 km\u00b2. Since the region is not well surveyed the AOO km\u00b2 might be larger, but some population might have also gone extinct due to the ongoing intensification of agriculture and the mining activities all over Angola. The habitat is further inferred to be under threat due to deforestation. The species is listed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "The Angola Sparklewing has only been recorded at 4 locations, which are spread over the range of the Planalto do Bi\u00e9 and the neighbouring Serra da Chela (Longfield (1947).
