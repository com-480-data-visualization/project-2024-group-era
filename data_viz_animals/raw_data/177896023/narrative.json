Some locations are with protected areas, for instance Hon Ba Nature Reserve. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but it is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 3,520\u20137,068 km\u00b2.
