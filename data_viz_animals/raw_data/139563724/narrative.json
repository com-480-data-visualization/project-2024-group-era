The only record from Dinagat is that of the type series from 1931. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is likely to be relatively small and is inferred to be declining as a result of loss and degradation of forest in north-eastern Mindanao. Similarly, the extent of occurrence (EOO) is not likely to be large and, based on the available data, is likely to be smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2. However, the overall population may not yet be severely fragmented so that the species does not qualify for Endangered with the available data and instead qualifies for and is assessed Vulnerable under criteria B1ab(ii,iii). </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Igneocnemis rubripes </em>is only known from Dinagat and Mindanao in the Philippines (Gassmann and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2002, Needham and Gyger 1939, the assessor also has unpublished data). The assessor is aware of records from at least seven locations but it has only been possible to assign separate coordinates to five of these for mapping purposes. The only record from Dinagat is that of the type series from 1931 without further location data. It is not clear if the species is present in any protected areas but it might be present, for instance, in the Cabadbaran River Watershed Forest Reserve within the Mount Hilong-hilong Important Bird Area. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is not possible with the available data, but it is likely to be relatively small and is inferred to be declining as a result of loss and degradation of forest in north-eastern Mindanao. Similarly, the EOO is not likely to be large; when calculated based on the mapped data points, EOO is 1,458 km\u00b2, however since this does not include its occurrence on Dinagat, this is certainly an underestimate. However, the known EOO is still likely to be less than 5,000 km\u00b2.</p>", "population": "<p>This species appears to be local in occurrence but can be moderately common where it does occur.
