In museums two additional specimen were found, labelled from Harar, Maraquo and \"E. Abyssinia\". The species might be more common, as the two sites are some distance from each other. If the species relies on forest streams, it is most likely under immediate threat, since forests are destroyed rapidly in Ethiopia. It is listed as Near Threatened, meeting criteria B1a(i,iii).", "geographicrange": "The species is only recorded from Ethiopia (Wush Wush, Wondo Genet). The localities are well apart and a wider distribution of the species can be assumed.", "population": "Population size is unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Clear and fast mountainous streams in forest.", "threats": "No information, but most likely to be affected by deforestation.", "conservationmeasures": "Research required into the species taxonomy, population and range, biology and ecology, habitat status, threats, potential conservation measures and trends/monitoring.", "usetrade": null}]}
