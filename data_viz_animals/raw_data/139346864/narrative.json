The species is only rarely encountered, but this may have as much to do with its habitat (it breeds in phytotelmata) as genuine rarity. However the available evidence suggests that it less common in logged forest than un-logged forest. This species meets some of the criteria for Vulnerable status (Bb(ii,iii)) except that the AOO is not known to be below 2,000km<sup>2</sup> and Least Concern does not seem justified with the available data, so the species is assessed as Near Threatened. It is to be hoped that re-assessment to Least Concern will be possible when more data are available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Pericnemis dowi</em> is endemic to Borneo, where it is known from Brunei (Dow &amp; Ngiam 2014, Orr &amp; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2013) and Sarawak (Dow &amp; Reels 2013, Dow &amp; Ngiam 2014, Dow <em>et al. </em>&#160;2013a, 2013b, 2018, 2019, Orr &amp; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2013). It is very likely to occur in parts of Kalimantan and Sabah but this requires confirmation. The assessor is aware of records from 14 locations, some in protected areas (for instance the Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary in Sarawak). No remotely accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this phytotelmata breeding species is possible with the available data, but the AOO can be inferred to be declining because of loss of forest throughout its range.</p>", "population": "<p>This species is seldom encountered but this may have as much to do with its habits and habitat as genuine rarity. Beyond this all that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of forest throughout the range of the species.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species breeds in phytotelmata, typically tree holes and buttress pans in mixed dipterocarp forest. Most records are from pristine forest but it has also been found in logged forest at a few locations. The species may be more common in unlogged forest where there are more phytotelmata. Most individuals are collected along forest trails or when they happen to be perched or foraging near to streams. An ongoing decline in both extent and quality of suitable habitat can be inferred from loss and degradation of forest throughout the range of the species.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from clear-cutting of forest for plantation establishment.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More information on the distribution of this species is needed, and on how common it is in logged forest.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
