While this species is known from a limited number of collection records, Extent of Occurrence is not expected to exceed 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Land-use changes in the Sixaola River drainage have had documented impacts on the area, extent, and quality of available habitat. Additionally, continuous fish kills resulting from pesticide pollution have been reported. As such, this species is assessed as Endangered (EN) under criterion B1ab(iii,v).

Adults inhabit flowing water from small creeks and streams to the shallows of large and fast flowing rivers. This species prefers rocky habitats with tree branches and leaf litter, and finds sanctuary in the various cracks and crevices provided by this type of environment, or among roots and debris. Adults and juveniles also occur in warm (20\u201336\u00b0C) pools of springs and their effluents (Conkel 1993, Bussing 1998). Diet is comprised of worms, crustaceans, insects, and plant matter (Conkel 1993, Bussing 1998, A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019).</p>  <p>This species lays eggs on cleaned surfaces of rocks or tree branches one or two times per year (up to six, depending on water conditions) (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019); parents incubate eggs, guard young, tend and fan embryos, and transport juveniles into newly excavated pits in the substrate (Conkel 1993, Bussing 1998, A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019). Dark cavities are preferred as nests to conceal the brood and make them less conspicuous to visual predators (Conkel 1993, Bussing 1998). Approximately 100-200 eggs are deposited and are vigorously guarded and cared for by both male and female (A.

Much of this region has been developed for plantation agriculture (primarily banana) and pastureland, resulting in habitat modification, deforestation, widespread pesticide pollution, and associated fish kills (Lorion and Kenney 2009, Polidoro and Morra 2016). These threats are inferred to have direct and continuous impacts on the area, extent, and quality of habitat, and reported fish kills infer a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals. </p>", "conservationmeasures": "There are currently no species-specific conservation actions directed towards <em>A. kanna</em>.
