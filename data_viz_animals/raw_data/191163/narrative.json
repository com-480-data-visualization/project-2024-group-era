In a study by Moncayo-Estrada<em> et al</em>. (2007), it was found that fish dominates its diet in both dry and rainy seasons, but that invertebrates increase in importance in the dry season and fish increase in importance in the rainy season. The primary prey consumed by juveniles belong to the zooplankton community, with the presence of insects, crayfish, and plant material indicating a subsequent consumption of periphytic organisms as the fish reached larger sizes (Moncayo-Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2007). Smaller&#160;<em>Chirostoma lucius</em>&#160;feed on a higher percentage of cladocerans and copepods, whereas the larger specimens diets are dominated by <em>Chirostoma</em> fish (Moncayo-Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2007). <em>Chirostoma lucius</em>&#160;is the largest species of its genus, reaching a standard length of 30 cm.<br/><br/>Built in 1949, the Guaracha Reservoir was constructed for the purpose of aquiculture, with an area of 1,162 ha and a mean depth of 2.6 m (INE 2003).&#160;<em>Chirostoma lucius</em>&#160;was one of a variety of fish&#160;introduced with the intent to promote an artisanal fishery, however, that population was thought to extirpated when the reservoir dried in 1985.", "threats": "<p>The primary threats to species of&#160;<em>Chirostoma</em>&#160;are habitat loss and degradation resulting from water flow reductions in the Lerma River, alongside an associated increase water residency time, nutrient enrichment due to agricultural runoff, the release of toxins and pollutants from municipal and industrial sources, overfishing resulting in potential stock collapse, competitive nonnative species (e.g.,&#160;<em>Oreochromis aureus</em>) and physical habitat alteration (Lyons<em> et al</em>. 1998, Becerra-Munoz<em> et al. </em>2003, de Anda <em>et al. </em>2004, Moncayo-Estrada <em>et al. </em>2012). Recent estimates suggest that over 3000 fishermen target various species of fishes in Lake Chapala annually (SAGARPA 2015).</p>Additionally, Lake Chapala has experienced a long-term continual decline in water volume primarily resulting from increased agricultural demand for ground and surface water, which comprises the majority of water-use in the region (SAGARPA 2015). Low water volume may be exacerbated by climatic fluctuations (Filonov <em>et al.</em> 2001, Filonov&#160;2002) and by increases in surface transpiration due to nutrient-induced presence of floating macrophytes (Lind and Davalos-Lind 2002).&#160;<em>Chirostoma lucius</em>, as one of the highest priced freshwater fishes in Mexico (Chacon and Rosas 1995), was observed to decline in catch, presumably due to over fishing, until 1998 when Mexican federal authorities closed the fishery in operation because of low population sizes (Moncayo-Estrada <em>et al</em>. 2003). The effect of the fishery closure on the population number of this species, and whether the fishing of this species has stopped throughout the lake, is unknown.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is also covered by the responsible fisheries regulation for the lake Chapala: 'NORMA Oficial Mexicana NOM-032-SAG/PESC-2015' (SAGARPA, 2015).&#160;This standard establishes the minimum catch size for white fish species (<em>Chirostoma promelas, C. sphyraena and C. lucius</em>) i.e. 200 mm length in total.", "usetrade": "<em>Chirostoma lucius,&#160;</em>together with <em>C. estor</em> of Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro, are the highest priced freshwater fishes in Mexico (Chacon and Rosas 1995) and are highly prized for food."}]}
