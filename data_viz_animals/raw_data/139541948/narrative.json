An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data is below 500 km\u00b2. The AOO will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed as such.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Pandanobasis mcgregori</em> is known from two locations on or around Mount Banahaw (a protected area) in Luzon in the Philippines (Needham and Gyger 1939, Villanueva 2012). Additionally, Villanueva and Gil (2011) recorded a species \u201ccf. <em>mcgregori</em>\u201d from Catanduanes; this taxon was not treated in Villanueva (2012) and its status remains unclear. Only the specimens from Luzon are considered to belong to <em>P. mcgregori </em>here. Mount Banahaw is included within the Mounts Banahaw\u2013San Cristobal protected landscape. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data is below 500 km\u00b2. The AOO will be declining due to loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range.</p>", "population": "<p>This appears to be a scarce species. Beyond this all that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range and that, if not confined to the Mount Banahaw area then the overall population will be severely fragmented.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Nothing was recorded on the habitats or ecology of this species but it will be forest dependent and is likely to be a phytotelmata-breeder. An ongoing decline in the extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred from loss and disturbance of forest throughout its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threats to this species will be from deforestation from agriculture and logging, also tourism (in a general sense) may have an impact at Mount Banahaw (see below). BirdLife International (2019) state that threats in this area \u201care from illegal logging, kaingin [slash and burn agriculture], encroachment into forest areas for permanent agriculture, and the collection of forest products. Hunting in the park remains a problem. Quarrying and mining activities around the park, especially in the towns of Dolores and Sariaya, began to operate in 1994. The large numbers of mountaineers and occasional hikers who visit the park, especially during the summer months (up to 5,000 hikers in a month), put considerable pressure on the natural environment. Moreover, during Holy Week, large numbers of pilgrims of several religious denominations converge on Mt Banahaw. Up to 300,000 pilgrim and hikers are reported to visit the area, particularly in the towns of Dolores and Sariaya\u201d.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for better protection for Mount Banahaw and its surroundings, protection of additional areas where it occurs (if any) and for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
