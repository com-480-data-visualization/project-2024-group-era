{"name": "190497027", "result": [{"species_id": 190497027, "taxonomicnotes": "Differences in morphological, ecological and behavioural traits suggest that the current five-species arrangement does not accurately reflect species diversity within <em>Kosciuscola</em> (Tatarnic <em>et al.</em> 2013, Umbers <em>et al.</em> 2021). Molecular work has identified species-level clades within <em>K. cuneatus</em>, with strong evidence that<em> K. cuneatus</em> proper is restricted to the Australian Capital Territory and northern New South Wales mountains (Umbers <em>et al.</em> 2021) and the remaining clades within <em>K. cuneatus </em>being&#160;undescribed species.&#160;<br/><br/>The recent emergence of major threats from climate change and bushfire, combined with the narrow ranges of these taxa as now understood, is here considered sufficient to justify assessing the reduced species concept of&#160;<em>K. cuneatus&#160;</em>pending formal publication of the forthcoming taxonomic revision, and to assess the undescribed congeners.", "rationale": "This species is listed as Endangered on the basis that it has an extent of occurrence below 4,500 km<sup>2</sup>, it is considered to occur in fewer than five locations defined by a primary threat from fire, and was subject to a decline in the number of mature individuals (as well as expected high mortality of overwintering eggs) and the quality and extent of its habitat as a result of the 2019-2020 bushfires. The timeframe over which comparable fire events may recur is unclear, but such events are expected to become more frequent and this threat is therefore considered to represent a projected continuing decline. Multiple additional threats have been identified, but the impacts of most on this at least previously common, adaptable species are uncertain.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in two major mountain blocks in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, between Namadji and Kosciuszko National Parks.&#160; It can be found around 1,000 to 1,900 m asl.", "population": "It can be fairly common in suitable habitat. Modelling based on overlaying fire maps on the species' range (National Environmental Science Program unpubl. data)&#160;estimates that 64% of suitable habitat within this species' extent of occurrence was impacted by fire, 46% of which was at high intensity. Mortality in mature adults and juveniles is thought likely to be at least 90% in areas subject to high intensity fire, and between 30 and 70-90% in areas of less intensive fire. On the assumption that this species occurs or occurred throughout the impacted area, this corresponds to a global decline resulting from this single event of at least 46%, and potentially nearly or more than 50%. Estimates of mortality from fire in the egg stage are uncertain, but as eggs are laid in shallow soil this is expected to be high at least in areas of high-intensity fire. The post-fire population trend is unknown. It is unknown whether this species occurs as a severely fragmented population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is a habitat generalist associated with woodland and open forest (20-80% canopy cover) and seems to be more common in forested than open habitats, with an upper elevation in the sub-alpine zone. It is found in leaf litter and vegetation, including standing wood. It can be found along creek lines but does not appear to be as dependent on water sources as <em>Kosciuscola&#160;</em>species found at higher elevations.&#160;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The adult lifespan is unlikely to exceed a few months, with eggs overwintering in the soil, and the generation time is less than a year. As this species exhibits a preference for shaded habitats at low to mid-elevations, it is unclear whether it is reliant on snow packs to protect overwintering eggs from temperature extremes.</span>", "threats": "Around 64% of suitable habitat in its range was impacted in the 2019-2020 bushfires, based on overlaying maps of fire impacted areas with the known range.<span style=\"\">&#160;Future bushfires, likely including those of comparable extent and intensity, are likely to become increasingly common in this area</span><span style=\"\">, and the intensity and impact exacerbated by increased desiccation resulting from climate change. It is unclear whether this species is as sensitive to this impact as species associated with more open habitats, as forest cover is likely to buffer it to some extent from temperature extremes, but parts of the range were exposed to very high intensity fires. It is thought that the species is likely to have been especially sensitive to fires in February 2020, which corresponds to the early breeding season in related species and so eggs and unmated adults are likely to have suffered high mortality. It is likely to be subject to some impact from invasive species, as it is a recorded prey item for foxes</span><span style=\"\">. Climate warming is likely to result in reduced snow</span><span style=\"\">, which may reduce survivorship of overwintering eggs in any subpopulations reliant on a snow pack to reduce exposure to low temperature extremes. There may be some impact from land use changes within its range, including the Snowy Hydro 2.0 development.&#160;</span>Fire management may be detrimental to this species especially if conducted in Autumn.", "conservationmeasures": "Most of this species' range lies within protected areas in Namadgi and Kosciuszko National Parks. Climate change mitigation needs to be the major focus of conservation efforts for this species. Consideration of the life cycle of this species is necessary when planning burns for bushfire management. Restoration of the habitat is needed in some areas. Minimizing development at higher elevations is recommended, as resorts are likely to exacerbate habitat loss already resulting from climate change.<br/><br/>The impact of most identified threats to this species, and the true rate of population decline, in this species are unclear and require further research. Fire management is likely to be somewhat effective in limiting population declines if undertaken with respect to the species\u2019 life cycle. Taxonomic research is needed to clarify species limits.", "usetrade": "There is no known or likely use of or trade in this species."}]}
