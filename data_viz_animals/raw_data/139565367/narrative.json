An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is unlikely to be large, and will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in eastern Mindanao and the overall population will be severely fragmented from the same cause. The extent of occurrence of the species will also not be particularly large and with the available data is less than 30,000km<sup>2</sup>.

One of the locations is near to the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary and another is near to the Aliwagwag Protected Landscape so the species may well be present in these protected areas. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is unlikely to be large, and will be declining due to loss and degradation of forest in eastern Mindanao. The extent of occurrence of the species will also not be particularly large.

It occurs in streams in disturbed forest as well as pristine forest but it is not known how much disturbance it can tolerate. An ongoing decline in extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred due to loss and degradation of forest throughout the range of the species.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threats to this species will be from clearance of forest for agriculture or as a result of logging and from mining (often illegal) and associated pollution of streams. These threats are also present in most protected areas in Mindanao.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more data on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance and for better protection for existing protected areas where it might occur.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
