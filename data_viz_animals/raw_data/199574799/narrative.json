Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 3.6-15 km<sup>2</sup> and the species is assigned to a&#160;single threat-based location. Total population size and population trend are unknown, but the species is naturally rare and is always found in low abundance. The primary threats to this species include habitat degradation and loss of suitable habitat associated with urban expansion, establishment of non-native species, and reductions in river flow and reductions in water quality associated with local climate change and intense use of surface and groundwater resources. Continuing decline in habitat quality and habitat availability is inferred. Therefore, <em>C. onca</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii). </p>", "geographicrange": "<p></p><p><em>Characidium onca</em> is known only from c\u00f3rrego Taquara and its tributaries that extend approximately 6.5 km in the upper Paran\u00e1 River basin in Distrito Federal, Brazil (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2021). C\u00f3rrego Taquara is a tributary of the ribeir\u00e3o do Gama which drains into Parano\u00e1 Lagoon in the Parana\u00edba River drainage (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). This species has not been reported from any other drainages, despite extensive genus-specific sampling in the region since the 1980s (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). </p>  <p>Area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 12 km<sup>2</sup> based on a 2x2 km grid overlain over georeferenced collection records (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 12-15 km<sup>2</sup>, with a lower estimate that is equivalent to the calculated AOO, and an upper estimate calculated by Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2021). This species is assigned to a single threat-based location, based on a highly restricted range and several locally pervasive threats that are impacting the ribeir\u00e3o do Gama drainage in its entirety (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).</p><br/><p></p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population status of this species are unknown.

Lago Parano\u00e1 was constructed in 1959 immediately downstream of collection sites, resulting in habitat modification towards a lentic system and loss of riparian vegetation (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Additionally, several non-native species are established in the reservoir and spread into habitat occupied by <em>C. onca</em> could result in competitive interaction and predation (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion in the area has replaced large areas of natural Cerrado vegetation, including along the left margin of the ribeir\u00e3o do Gama (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).

Despite these protections, the riberi\u00e3o do Gama basin is subject to urban expansion along the protected area boundary and revisions to the margins of the protected area to accommodate continued expansion of downtown Bras\u00edlia (Melo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Stronger site protection, reinforcement of water management policies, and recovery of impacted areas are recommend conservation priorities.
