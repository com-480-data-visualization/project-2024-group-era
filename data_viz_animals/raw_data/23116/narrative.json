Meek but regarded as <em>Goodea atripinnis</em>. In 1937, Hubbs and Turner transfered the species into the new erected genus <em>Xenoophorus</em> and described a second species in this genus, <em>Xenoophorus erro</em> from the R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda. In 1939 they described from endorheic streams near Venado and Moctezuma a third one, <em>Xenoophorus exsul</em>. J. Fitzsimons (1979) finally synonymized the last two species with <em>Xenoophorsu captivus </em>as he couldn't find any differences. According to three separate drainages, three subpopulations can be distinguished: The R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda subpopulation (type subpopulation), the R\u00edo Matehuala subpopulation from Venado and Moctezuma and the Illescas subpopulation, that inhabited the endorheic springs near Illescas and which is regarded Extinct in the Wild.", "rationale": "The Relict Splitfin is a freshwater fish endemic to the Mexican federal state of San Luis Potos\u00ed.

It also occurs in spring areas of an endorheic river (R\u00edo Matehuala) about 70 km north of the city of San Luis Potos\u00ed, especially in the springs in Venado and Moctezuma; it&#160;was also known to inhabit the endorheic springs at Illescas that dried up in 1996 (J.

All known habitats display stocks in low to moderate numbers, and the species seems to have a certain affinity to submerged vegetation. The Panuco subpopulation is severely affected by water exploitation, agriculture and droughts. Only a few localities persisted with small stocks. Additionally, large sections of the R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda became uninhabitable for the species due a Power Plant in Villa de Reyes using water to cool its engines. The subpopulation in Venado and Moctezuma are under pressure of non-native Green swordtails, which compete for food and space. The habitats are also used for recreation which causes water pollution, to a degree. The population of Illescas was extirpated by over exploitation of water for agriculture.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>The Relict Splifin uses habitats of springs and their outflows, small streams and ditches. This species lives over substrates of silt, mud, clay, sand, gravel and rocks in clear to murky water. It prefers depths of less than 1 m with slight to moderate currents. Aquatic vegetation is typically comprised of ubiquitous green algae and <em>Lemna</em>, <em>Eichhornia</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, <em>Nasturtium </em>and <em>Potamogeton&#160;</em>(Miller 2005). <br/></p><p>K\u00f6ck <em>et al.</em> (2014) surveyed the habitats in Venado and Moctezuma. The habitat of <em>Xenoophorus captivus</em> in Venado is a swift flowing spring-fed shallow creek in a light forest, approximately 5 m wide and 20 cm deep (some pools up to 50 cm deep) with ground made of sand, gravel, silt and rocks. Part of the embankment is made of submerged vegetation, mainly<em> Chara </em>species. The Relict Splitfin was found in low numbers within the dense vegetation, together with crayfish<em></em>. The creek itself showed moderate numbers of non-native green swordtails (<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) within the deeper pools. The habitat in Moctezuma is part of a recreation area, mainly used for picnics. It is a swift flowing creek, between 0.5 and 1.2 m deep and between 0.5 and 2 m wide, and is covered with dense submerged vegetation<em></em>. The Relict Splitfin was found mainly in the deeper sections, over ground of sand and silt with few rocks and plants, but within a thick system of tree roots. <br/></p><p></p>", "threats": "The Relict Splitfin occurs in spring and streams within a very arid area and therefore faces severe threats. Besides water pollution from agriculture and domestic sewage, non-native fish (especially Poeclids:&#160;<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em> and <em>Poecilia mexicana</em>)<em></em>&#160;also occur in part of its habitats. In Venado, swordtails are the main species populating the creek, with <em>Xenoophorus captivus</em> hiding in vegetation. Water exploitation and groundwater pumping, especially in combination with droughts caused by climate change, threatens almost all habitats and have caused populations of Illescas to disappear. In addition, the energy production is an important threat to parts of the population. For example, the Power Plant in Villa de Reyes uses water from the R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda to cool itsengines, leading to river desiccation in the dry season and making the river uninhabitable across large sections.", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The only ongoing conservation effort is a monitoring and<em> ex-situ</em> breeding project run by the Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Acuatica in Michoacan University, Morelia, Mexico.</p>", "usetrade": "The Relict Splitfin is not used for human consumption and is not targeted for the ornamental fish trade."}]}
