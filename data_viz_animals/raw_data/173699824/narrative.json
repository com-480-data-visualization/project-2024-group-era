The species should be searched for in Yunnan as well as Viet Nam. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is certainly less than 500 km\u00b2. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to development in the Sa Pa area. Although possibly tolerant of some disturbance, the species appears to be both very local in occurrence and at best uncommon. Its maximum extent of occurrence (EOO) is just 570 km\u00b2. Since there are threats to the only known sites Data Deficient does not appear appropriate for this species and taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN it is assessed as Endangered (EN B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii)), although it is to be hoped that when more information is available on its distribution, reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Anotogaster sapaensis</em> is known from the type locality, Sa Pa in Lao Cai Province, North Viet Nam (Karube 2012) and another site very close to the first (Kompier unpublished), the two sites are sufficiently close together that they should perhaps be considered as one threat-defined location (taking development and associated pollution of streams as the main threats in the area).

One of the assessors (T. Kompier) found an individual emerging from the larva at a muddy pool at the bottom of a rocky stream cascading off a mountain, alongside a road, this stream was not under heavy forest cover, although bushes remained. However the adult is likely to require forest at least for roosting and the species is probably at least weakly forest-dependent. The known sites are at high altitude. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are observed to be declining due to development in the Sa Pa area.</p>", "threats": "<p></p><p>It is not possible to adequately assess the threats faced by this species with the available data.
