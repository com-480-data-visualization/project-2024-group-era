It occurs in a single location and exhibits preference to a habitat that is severely at risk from water abstraction, and drought and temperature extremes driven by climate change. These threats could plausibly push the species into Critically Endangered or Extinct very quickly. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable (VU D2).", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to Greece, where it is known from only a Nestos River side-spring close to Stena of Nestos (Xanthi Prefecture, Greece) (Glo\u00ebr <em>et al</em>. 2018).", "population": "No population data (size or trends) exist for this species", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This aquatic snail was found in a high water-flow spring. Individual specimens are usually found on small and medium sized stones.", "threats": "Its habitat is severely at risk from human activities, such as water abstraction, and from the effects of climate change, especially temperature extremes. The species is known only from a single location.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are in effect for the species. Appropriate maintenance of the spring is essential to avoid accidental damage to the habitat.", "usetrade": "The species is not used or traded."}]}
