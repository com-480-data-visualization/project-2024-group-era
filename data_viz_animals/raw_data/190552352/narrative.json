The species has a very narrow distribution and the area this species inhabits is heavily affected by deforestation, urban centres and agriculture, with associated pressures on the aquatic environment. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 230&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 48 km<sup>2</sup>. There are two threat-based locations based on the widespread transformation of the regional landscape into agricultural land.", "geographicrange": "<em>Melanorivulus ivinhemensis</em>&#160;was described from the river Ivinhema in Paran\u00e1 river basin, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (Volcan <em>et al</em>. 2018). The records include some wetlands near to the type locality in Ivinhema drainage.

The wetlands where the species occurs have varied depths (20-70 cm), waters ranging from clear to turbid, and muddy or clayey substrates (Volcan <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species can reach 30.4 mm in standard length. There is probably a reduction of the habitat in area and quality due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier.", "threats": "Streams and wetlands in plains are the critical habitat for the species, where there is a reported broad expansion of the agricultural frontier. Deforestation is extensive and towns, villages and industries occur in the distribution area.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no specific measures in place for the conservation of the species <em>Melanorivulus ivinhemensis</em>.&#160;According with IUCN and UNEP-WCMC (2020) the species is detected in Parque Nacional de Ilha Grande and \u00c1rea De Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental Ilhas e V\u00e1rzeas do Rio Paran\u00e1. Habitat protection in the most impacted drainages and awareness are recommended. Research and monitoring of the population, threats and habitat is recommended.", "usetrade": "There is no information on the possible use and trade in this species.
