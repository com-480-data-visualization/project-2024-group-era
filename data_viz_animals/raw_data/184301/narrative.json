{"name": "184301", "result": [{"species_id": 184301, "taxonomicnotes": "<span style=\"\"></span>", "rationale": "An Ethiopian endemic of montane forest streams with a likely occurrence in mountains in southern Sudan. Though there are records from several places in Ethiopia, all more recent records (less than than 50 years old) are from the Kafa area in south-west Ethiopia. Since Ethiopia has undergone tremendous changes concerning the forest cover in the last decades (deforestation in large areas) and more recently pollution of streams and rivers is becoming a major issue, <em>Zosteraeschna waterstoni</em> is listed as Vulnerable. This is based on the few localities and AOO and EOO (post 1990 records only, as the earlier records are assumed extinct). More surveys are urgently needed, since the once widespread species in the Ethiopian highlands might be restricted to the few remaining forest pockets and might undergo further declines with the current population growth and intensification of agriculture and industries in Rwanda.", "geographicrange": "Some of the records are very old and were omitted for the assessments. This includes three records from Sudan (Jebel Marra, 1964, Derriba Lakes and Killing, both 1932). Recent records are only from upland Ethiopia, concentrated in south-west Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Hawker might still be present in mountainous areas in southern Sudan.", "population": "The decrease of population size is inferred based on the loss of habitat over the last decades.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "Montane forest streams.", "threats": "This main threats facing this species are deforestation and water pollution.", "conservationmeasures": "Protection of Ethiopia's remaining natural forests (law inforcement). Reforestation along rivers and streams (10 m natural vegetation on each side of any water body). Immediate stop of water pollution by a country wide introduction of waste water treatments.", "usetrade": null}]}
