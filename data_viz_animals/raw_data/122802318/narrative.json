{"name": "122802318", "result": [{"species_id": 122802318, "taxonomicnotes": "<p>The taxonomic history of this species, and confusion over the female are discussed in detail in H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2009). However females stated to be of this species in H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2009), from Mount Kinabalu, where the altitude of collection is known, are from higher altitudes than have been recorded for the male (the species was described from somewhere on Mount Kinabalu, but the exact type locality and its altitude are not known) and might not actually belong to <em>R. stygia</em>.</span></p>", "rationale": "<p><em>Rhinocypha stygia</em> is endemic to Borneo where it is known from scattered locations in Brunei, Sabah and Sarawak. It is apparently absent from many areas where seemingly suitable habitat exists and might be particularly sensitive to logging activities. Declines in overall population, area of occupancy (AOO), quality and extent of suitable habitat are certainly ongoing and threats exist at all locations. Although the species does not qualify for Vulnerable status with the available information, Least Concern status does not appear suitable for this species, and it is assessed as Near Threatened because its AOO is likely to be small (close to the 2,000km<sup>2</sup> threshold for Vulnerable), and because of the other ongoing declines already mentioned. Hopefully when more data are available it may be possible to re-assess this species as Least Concern.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rhinocypha stygia</em> is endemic to Borneo where it is known from Brunei (Orr 2001), Sabah (for instance in Chung <em>et al. </em>2013, Huisman &amp; van Tol 1989, Kitagawa et al 1999, Luke <em>et al. </em>2017), the type locality is Mount Kinabalu in Sabah (F\u00f6rster 1897) but the exact type locality is not known and might not be within the present day National Park. However most recent records are from Sarawak (for instance in Dow &amp; Ngiam 2015, Dow &amp; Reels 2008, Dow <em>et al </em>2018, Kimmins 1936, there is also as-yet unpublished data generated by the assessor). Some locations in Brunei and Sarawak are within protected areas (for instance the Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary and Gunung Mulu National Park). The assessor is aware of records from 23-24 locations. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but given that the species is apparently absent from many areas of seemingly suitable habitat within its range, it may not be large and will certainly be declining, as will the quality and extent of suitable habitat.</p>", "population": "<p>This species can be moderately common where it occurs and may be under-recorded due to its habits. However it appears to be absent from nay areas of suitable habitat and this will have been exacerbated by loss of forest, so that the overall population is likely to be severely fragmented. Beyond this little can be said with the available information except that some decline in overall population will have occurred and be ongoing due to loss of forest within its range.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Where the habitat has been recorded this species has been found at streams with a pebble or rocky substrate in lowland mixed dipterocarp forest. At the majority of locations the forest is pristine or close to pristine but at some it has been disturbed, sometimes heavily disturbed, by logging activities. Where the altitude is known, the species has been found below 500m a.s.l. However it is apparently absent at many locations fitting the above description, suggesting that we do not fully understand its habitat requirements. One possibility is that it is particularly sensitive to logging, so that it has only survived in a few areas that have been logged, but this is certainly not confirmed.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from clear cutting of forest, which within its range is mostly happening for plantation establishment. It is possible that this species is particularly sensitive to logging activities, but this needs confirmation. Forest fires are a threat even at protected locations.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More data on the distribution of this species, and its exact habitat requirements and tolerance to logging activities, is needed. It should be searched for in Kalimantan as well as within its known range. It would benefit from good conservation practices in plantations, such as leaving wide buffers of original forest around streams and the setting up of conservation areas consisting of original forest and including stream heads, and the strict enforcement of existing regulations for plantations and for logging activities.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
