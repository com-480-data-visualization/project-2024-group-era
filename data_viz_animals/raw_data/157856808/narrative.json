{"name": "157856808", "result": [{"species_id": 157856808, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. It is currently known from three restricted locations in the distinctive and restricted habitat of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 870 to 1,720 m bsl. Two of these locations lie within deep-sea mining exploration licence areas granted by the ISA. As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted area of occupancy (AOO), and has been found at a limited number of locations, it would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction at these deep-sea mining sites. However, the other location lies within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) and this population is protected from the impacts of commercial exploitation and deep-sea mining. Therefore, owing to the significant protection provided by this MPA and the resulting variability in extinction risk for the different populations, we have opted to assess the species as Near Threatened (NT).&#160;The species is close to qualifying for a threatened category based on the potential threat of mining activity in a subset of locations where the species occurs. As such, the assessment as NT is dependent on the maintenance of the current marine protection at the Azorian vent field, the cessation of which would result in the taxon becoming threatened in a short period of time. A reassessment would therefore be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of the MPA, whereby the species would become EN B2ab(iii), based on the projected continuing decline in habitat quality associated with the two locations in mining licence areas.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to three locations at hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.&#160;Location 1 lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of The Azores, Portugal. Locations 2 and 3 lie beyond national jurisdiction in International Waters. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1,685 to 4,090 m bsl. It has been observed from three vent fields: at the Lucky Strike vent field (Location 1), the Snake Pit vent field (Location 2), and the Ashadze-1 vent field (Location 3) (Waren and Bouchet 2001, Fabri<em> et al</em>. 2011, Goroslavskaya and Galkin 2011). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Waren and Bouchet 2001, Fabri<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2011, Goroslavskaya and Galkin 2011).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Atlantic Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1,685 to 4,090 m bsl.", "threats": "Several vent fields on the Mid-Atlantic ridges lie in seabed areas under licence for exploration for polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents (Van Dover <em>et al.</em> 2018), with mining activity proposed at two of the three vent locations where this species occurs. Exploration-phase licences for the regions where the Snake Pit and Ashadze-1 vent fields are found were granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to Institut Fran\u00e7ais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER) and the Government of the Russian Federation, respectively, under 15-year contracts (2015-2030). The ISA exploration-phase licences allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing, hence there may already be disturbance of subpopulations. Both direct impacts from mineral extraction and indirect disturbance from adjacent activities could impact local subpopulations. Evidence from published reports suggest that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al. </em>2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact of these activities is uncertain. While these vent fields would be susceptible to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted, the other location within the range of this species is protected from deep-sea mining by an Azorian Marine Protected Area.", "conservationmeasures": "The Lucky Strike vent field, which lies within the Azorean-Portuguese Economic Exclusive Zone, is a Marine Protected Area (MPA) and considered a Special Areas of Conservation under the European Habitats Directive (Calado <em>et al.</em> 2011, Aguiar and Costa 2010), where the Azores Regional Government protects it from commercial and scientific exploitation. This MPA is designed specifically to protect hydrothermal vent environments, safeguarding one of the three locations where the species is found. However, there are no conservation actions currently in place at the other two locations where this species is found, at Snake Pit or Ashadze-1 vent fields. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on these populations from disturbance by mining.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
