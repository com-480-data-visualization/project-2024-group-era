The documented area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is 4 km<sup>2</sup>. However, Bigge Island comprises a surface area of 171 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and a large portion of the island supports potentially suitable habitat. We suspect that the actual geographic range of this species is&#160;larger than currently documented.&#160;Bigge Island is uninhabited and unused Crown Land and there is no documented or inferred past or continuing decline in the area and/or quality of habitat due to anthropogenic impact. Despite this, based on its small extent of AOO, the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2 because any potential future disturbance, such as human lit bushfires, has the potential to impact the entire population of this species rapidly.&#160;Should the species be recorded from other parts of Bigge Island in the future, then its AOO may increase to more than 20 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and the species could be assessed as Least Concern.", "geographicrange": "<p>This species is endemic to Bigge Island, Montague Sound, NW Kimberley, Australia (K\u00f6hler 2011).
