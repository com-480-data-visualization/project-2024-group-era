{"name": "60920", "result": [{"species_id": 60920, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species occurs in Lake Malawi as well as in Lake Malombe. It has a widespread distribution but with a sharply declined population size at most places known. The population is estimated to have suffered a more than 30% overall decrease in the last 10 years caused by the incessant use of beach seines. It&#160;is therefore listed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lakes Malawi and Malombe. It is widespread throughout Lake Malawi where it was common in the south.", "population": "The population is in decline.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species lives over sandy areas in shallow water and prefers depths ranging from 3\u201315 m. It feeds on small benthic invertebrates exposed by other large sand dwelling species (e.g., <em>Taeniolethrinops</em> spp.) with which it is normally associated. Reproduction occurs whenever ripe females and males meet as the males do not build bowers nor defend territories. The maximum size is 23 cm total length (TL).", "threats": "Overfishing using beach seines is a threat to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "It occurs in Lake Malawi National Park. Population trend monitoring is recommended.", "usetrade": "The species is no longer targeted by the ornamental fish trade, but was previously known as '<em>Haplochromis moorii</em>' in the trade. It is, however, targeted by artisanal fishermen using beach seines and is locally known under many different names, one of them \"Gundamwala\"."}]}
