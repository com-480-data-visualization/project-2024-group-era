There is an report from the giz on this issue (<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/giz2015-en-tfca-chimanimani.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.giz.de/en/downloads/giz2015-en-tfca-chimanimani.pdf</a>) and the situation was reported as serious by local conservationists: \"The situation in the Chimanimanis is that there is considerable impact of alluvial goldmining along the upper streams and rivers, particularly on the Mozambique side of the mountains. The impact on the general ecosystem of the mountain habitats is limited and probably not lasting but certainly more serious to the those habitats directly bound to the streams and stream banks such as your Odonata species\".(e-mail from Bart Wursten on 11th September 2016).
