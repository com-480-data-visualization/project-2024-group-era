Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2 </sup>and the species is assigned to a single threat-based location.

The primary threat to this species is the persistence of <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em> and <em>Astronotus ocellatus</em>, two non-native piscivores that likely prey on <em>C. akroa</em>. Continuing decline in population and in the number of mature individuals is inferred. Therefore, <em>C. akroa</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(v)+2ab(v). Immediate conservation priorities include invasive species eradication, site protection, habitat monitoring, and population monitoring. <em>Ex-situ</em> propagation and reintroduction into suitable habitat may be warranted.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cynolebias akroa </em>is known only from its type locality, a temporary pool beside the highway BA-225 at Santa Rita de C\u00e1ssia in the Preto River drainage, S\u00e3o Francisco River basin, Bahia state, Brazil (Nielsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p>  <p>Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a single 2x2 km grid overlain on top of the type locality.

The pool is characterized by a substrate of clay and sand, slightly dark water, a dense cover of aquatic vegetation composed of <em>Echinodorus</em> sp. and <em>Nymphaea</em> sp., an average depth of 1 m, a pH of 6.5, and low conductivity (Nielsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The pool is close to a road near a small village and has been modified at one end so that water is retained throughout the year (Nielsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).
