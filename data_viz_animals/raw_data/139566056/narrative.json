Threats exist across the range of the species and severe fragmentation is believed to have already occurred. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data is below 500 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely less than 5,000 km\u00b2. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta belyshevi</em> is known from Leyte, Panaon and Bohol in the Philippines (van Tol 2005). The assessor is aware of records from as many as 9 separate locations but it has only been possible to assign coordinates to six of these for mapping purposes. Van Tol (2005) presents somewhat contradictory information on the presence of this species in Samar, stating \u201cspecimens from Samar are here considered specifically distinct\u201d but also listing a single female from Samar under this species. The record from Samar is considered uncertain here and not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence (EOO). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data is below 500&#160;km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely to be smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2 (EOO = 3,008-6,271 km\u00b2, based on the area within a minimum convex polygon around the known localities and around the occupied HydroBASIN areas).</p>", "population": "<p></p><p>Van Tol (2005: 218) states \u201cApparently occurring only in low densities on most sites, since only short series are available\u201d.

Considerable deforestation is evident on all islands where this species is known to occur, particularly in Bohol.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for protection of habitat where it occurs and for more information on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
