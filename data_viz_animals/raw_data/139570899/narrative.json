An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is not likely to be large and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of lowland forest throughout Palawan. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by that of Palawan (approximately 12,189 km\u00b2) and therefore significantly less than 20,000 km\u00b2 and when calculated using minimum convex polygon is less than 5,000 km\u00b2. Severe fragmentation is likely. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly. It is to be hoped that when more data on its distribution in Palawan become available it will be possible to reassess this species to Vulnerable or Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Macromidia asahinai</em> is known with certainty only from Palawan in the Philippines (Asahina 1980, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.

The assessor is aware of records from five locations but can only assign separate coordinates to four of these for mapping purposes. It occurs in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area (which may gain protected status) and is likely to occur in the Mount Mantalingajan Protected Landscape and St Paul's Subterranean River National Park (but this requires confirmation). An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. The extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by the area of Palawan (approximately 12,189 km\u00b2) and calculated using <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"http://geocat.kew.org/\">http://geocat.kew.org</a> is only 371.142 km\u00b2, however, and especially given that one location is omitted from the calculation, the true EOO will be greater than this.</p>", "population": "<p>Few individuals of this species have ever been collected but this may have as much to do with difficulty of capture as genuine rarity. Beyond this all that can be said is that that an ongoing decline in overall population will be taking place due to loss and degradation of forest on Palawan and that severe fragmentation is likely for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Nothing has been recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but based on other species from the same genus it will be forest-dependent and occur at streams. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation resulting from agriculture and logging. BirdLife International (2019, but based on information from 2001) note (for Palawan in general) that \u201cSmall-scale timber extraction and well-organised logging operations are hastening the depletion of the forest cover on the island\u201d, this is despite the fact that the entire island is a Biosphere reserve. </p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more information on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Protection of areas in Palawan where the species occurs (for instance Cleopatra\u2019s Needle) is highly desirable. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
