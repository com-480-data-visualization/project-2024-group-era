{"name": "44249", "result": [{"species_id": 44249, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Victoria and is only known for certain from&#160;Hannington Bay, Buvuma Island and north of Dagusi Island in the Ugandan waters of Lake Victoria. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 850 km\u00b2. The population is considered to be severely fragmented as this is a rare species and the threat of pollution has reduced the area of and fragmented the suitable habitat. This threat is also leading to continuing declines in habitat. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species was first described from Hannington Bay, Buvuma Island and north of Dagusi Island in the Ugandan waters of Lake Victoria at 7-15 m depth (Mandahl-Barth 1954). It was not recorded by Ngupula and Kayanda (2010) nor Mwabungu (2004) from the Tanzanian waters.<br/><br/><em><br/></em>", "population": "There are insufficient data for a population trend assessment.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species was found within the lake at depths of 7-15 m in bays and off the islands (Mandahl-Barth 1954,&#160;Mussel-P 2016).&#160;The species probably requires a host-fish during the life-cycle, but there are no data on species specificity.", "threats": "Specific threats to the species are not known, however  there are general threats from water pollution caused by sewage disposal given the levels of development on the islands.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures are known to be in place for this species. Recommended actions include further research, including taxonomic research, to provide better data for future conservation assessments.", "usetrade": "There is no known use or trade in this species."}]}
