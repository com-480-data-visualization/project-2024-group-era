The species has a narrow distribution in plains of upper Vapu\u00e9s, but occurs in protected areas and probably has a stable population trend. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 351&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) best estimated&#160;at 56 km<sup>2</sup>. The agricultural and mining frontier is advancing rapidly over regional ecosystems and currently represent the greatest threats. There is a best estimate of two threat-based locations based on these threats. It is believed that these stressors will continue in the future, affecting aquatic ecosystems and their fish.", "geographicrange": "<em>Rineloricaria jurupari</em>&#160;was described from the Ca\u00f1o La Tigra, Unilla River drainage, tributary to the upper Vaup\u00e9s River sub-basin, Amazon basin, Colombia (Londo\u00f1o-Burbano and Urbano-Bonilla 2018).
