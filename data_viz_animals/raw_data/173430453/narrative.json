It is only known from the male and recorded from three localities in a restricted area. It has an estimated extent of occurrence of 813 km\u00b2. However, the species is likely to be under-collected and is suspected to occur at up to 15 locations. There is an ongoing decline of suitable habitat due to crop cultivation and erosion by dam banks. The species is therefore listed as Near Threatened under the B criterion.", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to South Africa and found in the Free State province.", "population": "There is currently no population information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is a free-living, burrow-dweller. The males have so far been collected exclusively by pitfall traps in spring and early summer (September to early December) in the Grassland Biome. The males are collected in pitfall traps during the mating season because they move around looking for females. They are found in areas with dark vertic clay and loamy-clay soils, usually near water bodies and not from sites with sandy soils.", "threats": "Threatened by habitat loss due to crop cultivation, erosion of river and dam banks and habitat degradation from livestock grazing.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is protected in the Erfenis Dam Nature Reserve and Bloemfontein National Botanical Gardens.", "usetrade": null}]}
