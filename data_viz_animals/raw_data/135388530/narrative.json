It is found on the Atlantic versant of Mexico in the states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas (Schmitter-Soto 2017), originally described from two localities in the Nautla and Cucharas rivers (the latter a tributary of Laguna de Tamiahua) and recently found by Stevens (2017) at a third locality in the area (R\u00edo Pantepec, hydrological region Nautla-Tuxpan). The species is potentially threatened by pollution from agricultural run-off and domestic sewage. With an extent of occurrence of approximately 7000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160; and three locations based on the most plausible threat (pollution), the species is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "<em>Astyanax tamiahua </em>occurs at the northernmost limit of the Neotropical realm in the central-northern Gulf of Mexico.
