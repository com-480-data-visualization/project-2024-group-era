{"name": "191371", "result": [{"species_id": 191371, "taxonomicnotes": "Holotype and Paratypes of this species were taken by Clarence L. Turner from the R\u00edo Tamazula in Jalisco, just above the town of Tamazula de Giordano in April 1939. In the following years, this species was found to inhabit the R\u00edo Tamazula/ Tuxp\u00e1n system downstream to about the town of San Marcos, 12km SE of Tuxp\u00e1n, upper R\u00edo Coahuayana sections. Furthermore, it was collected in the R\u00edo El Tule drainage above El Pihuamo, an affluent of the middle R\u00edo Coahuayana section (named R\u00edo Naranjo). From the distribution in two distinct river systems, two subpopulations, the R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n subpopulation (type subpopulation) and the R\u00edo El Tule subpopulation, can be inferred.", "rationale": "<em>Allodontichthys tamazulae </em>was historically known from the state of Jalisco throughout the upper Coahuayana River basin (r\u00edos Tamazula and Tuxp\u00e1n) and from upper sections of an affluent of the middle section of this river (named R\u00edo Naranjo), the R\u00edo El Tule. Pollution from a sugar cane mill near the town of  Tamazula has made a portion of the former range of the species in the  lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970\u2019s (Lyons and  Mercado-Silva 2000). Additional pollution from waste water from the town of Tuxp\u00e1n, and from sewage from a huge paper mill in Atenquique (Garc\u00eda 2008), leads to an ongoing decline in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy and quality of habitats. From 1995 to 2016, the species has  been found at about 10 collection sites, several of them moderately large, and recent surveys indicate that probably all of these populations still persist and have been quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's. <br/><br/>Though the best case scenario of the estimated extent of occurence (1,350 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (280 km<sup>2</sup>) meets the threshold for Endangered, due to a high number of locations (9&#160; and relatively stable stocks, this species is assessed&#160;Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "The Tuxp\u00e1n Splitfin is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco, historically widely distributed in the upper sections of the R\u00edo Coahuayana (Miller <em style=\"\">et al.</em>&#160;2005), named r\u00edos Tamazula and Tuxp\u00e1n&#160;(downstream to about the town of San Marcos), and the upper R\u00edo El Tule drainage (r\u00edos El Terrero and La Trampa), an affluent of the R\u00edo Naranjo, the name of the R\u00edo Coahuayana section following the R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n. The historical extent of occurrence included several affluents of the r\u00edos Tamazula and Tuxp\u00e1n, the r\u00edos Contla, San Gregorio (San Jeronimo or Cobianes) and Atenquique, and the arroyos (creeks) Tecalitl\u00e1n and Espanatica. Due to water pollution caused by sugar cane mills (e.g. Tamazula de Giordano), by sewage from the town of Tuxp\u00e1n and by a huge paper mill in Atenquique, it is inferred that nowadays the main river is only scarcely populated with this species, and the R\u00edo Tamazula past the sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano is thought to be uninhabitable (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However, it still inhabits the listed affluents and the R\u00edo Tamazula above the sugar cane mill; in total, it is known from about 10 collection sites. Several surveys between 1995 and 2016 indicate that this species still persists at all of these sites, in quite stable numbers, since the 1980's and 1990's (Lyons 2011).<br/><br/>In 2008, it was estimated that the Tamazula Splitfin had disappeared from about 55% of its historical range (Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).", "population": "From its distribution in two distinct river systems, two subpopulations (the R\u00edo El Tule and the R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n subopulation) can be inferred. <br/><br/>The R\u00edo El Tule subpopulation is probably restricted to the R\u00edo El Terrero downstream to sections of this river just below El Pozo Santo and to one of its affluents, the R\u00edo La Trampa (Arroyo San Jos\u00e9 de Tule). Discharges from a sugar cane mill in San Jos\u00e9 de Tule and sewage from these two towns seem to deteriorate the water quality of this river significantly, making it uninhabitable for this species downstream. Due to its restricted range and declining stocks, this subpopulation is regarded Endangered. <br/><br/>The R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n subpopulation was found in the R\u00edo Tamazula/Tuxp\u00e1n system from approximately La Garita downstream to just below Atenquique, encompassing some of its affluents like the r\u00edos Contla and San Grergorio and the arroyos Tecalitl\u00e1n and Espanatica. This subpopulation is threatened by waste waters from a sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano, making the river section after the town uninhabitable for this species since the 1970's (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However the species occurred in several surveys by Lyons (1999 - 2010) in the R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n, so it seems to persist there though it is scarce (T. Lyons pers. comm. 2018, K\u00f6ck <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). From most of its affulents, the stocks seem to have remained quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's (Lyons 2011). Taking into consideration the restricted range and population declines in some of the habitats, this subpopulation is regarded Vulnerable.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "The Peppered Splitfin&#160;is known to inhabit permanent freshwater rivers in the R\u00edo Coahuayana basin in the state of Jalisco and occurs in rocky streams&#160;and riffles over  substrates of sand, rocks and boulders. The vegetation associated to its habitat is typically  green algae, sometimes sparse or asbsent, especially in large rivers where  the species is scarce. The currents are slight or moderate to swift, the  water is turbid or clear. It can be found in depths of 1 m, but usually  it prefers depths of 0.5 m or less.&#160;Like all known&#160;<em>Allodontichthys </em>species, the Peppered Splitfin is a bottom-dwelling and riffle-inhabitating<strong>&#160;</strong>species (Lyons 2011).<br/><br/>Observations of K\u00f6ck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in March 2016 in the R\u00edo Contla about 100 m north of the Highway 110 bridge at Contla, revealed a very shallow habitat with water depths less than 30 cm and a width of 3 to 4 m; in the rainy season the width reaches to about 8m, inferred from the existing pebble shore. The habitat was structured with a few big rocks and boulders in the middle of the current, a lot of gravel of different sizes, mud, sand and silt. There were few patches of submersed vegetation (Characeae) could be seen in the more quiet parts of the creek. The current was mainly swift, the water clear. The water parameters about noon were: pH 7.6, carbonate hardness 3\u00b0, total hardness 7\u00b0, water temperature 22\u00b0C. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, a discharge of polluted water close to the bridge raised the pH to 8.6 and led to the occurence of nitrite (1 mg/l) and nitrate (25 mg/l) that were absent above the discharge pipe.&#160;<em>Allodontichthys tamazulae&#160;</em>was associated with its congener&#160;<em>Allodontichthys hubbsi</em>&#160;(in about the same quantity),&#160;<em>Ilyodon whitei&#160;</em>(dominant species, about 90% of the total number of fish),&#160;<em>Poeclia butleri</em>&#160;and Tilapias (species not determined). The top predator seemed to be Dobsonfly larvae (subfamily Corydalinae, family Corydalidae) of about 10 - 12 cm in length, that could be seen hunting successfully twice in 30 minutes.&#160;<br/><br/>The R\u00edo Tamazula east of Tamazula de Giordano has a width of 5 to 10 m with a depth of about 50 cm. The bottom is comprised of big rocks and boulders, gravel, silt, mud and sand. The water in March 2016 was swift to torrential, depending on ground and width, and clear to murky. The water parameters were similar to the ones from the R\u00edo Contla. The species was associated with the same fish as in its affluent, and a few&#160;<em>Xenotoca lyonsi </em>were also found. The embankment was comprised by small trees (probably&#160;<em>Salix</em>), reeds and few herbaceous riparian plants; the main sections of the riverbank were free of vegetation. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, viscous remains of burnt sugar cane were found very close by: this would be washed into the river with rain.", "threats": "<em></em>Water pollution has been identified as main threat for this species. Sewage from a sugar cane mill near the town of Tamazula de Giordano has made a portion of the former range of the species in the lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970\u2019s (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). Moreover, waste water from a huge paper mill at Atenquique has had a heavilyy negative impact on downstream sections of the R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n (Garc\u00eda 2008), enhanced by sewage from the town of Tuxp\u00e1n. Additional threats include wash-in of fertilizers and pesticides from ubiquitous sugar cane fields, in addition to sediment as a result of almost entire deforestation in the headwaters of the R\u00edo Atenquique (and other affluents of the R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n), along with the R\u00edo Tuxp\u00e1n itself for paper production. It is also threatened by non-native fish species (Tilapias).", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions for <em>Allodontichthys tamazulae</em>&#160;are known.", "usetrade": "This species is neither traded or utilised as food nor as an ornamental species for aquariums."}]}
