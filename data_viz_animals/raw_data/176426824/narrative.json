Modifications caused by land use change to farms, urbanization, road  construction, and dams for irrigation in agriculture are the main  threats of this species. There is a single location based on these threats. At present, it is unknown as to whether the threats are causing continuing declines. However, it is possible that they could push the species to becoming Endangered or Critically Endangered in a very short time period. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "This species is native to the G\u00fcyraugua River in Paraguay (Gery and Mahnert 1993, Fricke <em>et al. </em>2020).", "population": "The population documentation is null. Research and monitoring is needed to know population composition, structure, size and trend.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This is a rare species (based on scarce material in collections) probably with an extreme restriction in its distribution due to its high degree of endemism. There is no documented information about its general ecology and habitat preferences.", "threats": "The distribution is located near a main road or highway in Paraguay and also in a region of importance for the agriculture and cattle sectors. Modifications caused by land use change to farms, urbanization, road construction, and dams for irrigation in agriculture are the main threats of this species.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no research, monitoring and planning known to be conducted. Research is necessary into its taxonomy, population, ecology and threats.", "usetrade": "This species is in the aquarium trade, as are most tetras. Rare species are usually highly valued in this trade."}]}
