In 2003, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen described the population from northern Thailand as a separate species, <em>C. angka</em>.", "rationale": "<em>Caliphaea angka</em> is known from three, fragmented locations in Thailand and Yunnan, China. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but, with only three records known, it is unlikely to be large. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. The minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) for this species is well above the threatened thresholds for criterion B. Despite its presence in a protected area in Thailand (but, where threats certainly exist) and a relatively large EOO, with only three locations and ongoing threats, there are some causes for concern for this species. If the locality in Thailand was lost, it is possible that this species could rapidly move into Critically Endangered. Therefore, taking a reasonable precautionary approach, it is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2. It is to be hoped that when more data are available that reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.", "geographicrange": "<em>Caliphaea angka</em> is known from three localities (interpreted as locations based on the plausible threats and the distribution of the species) in Thailand and Yunnan, China (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2017, Zhang 2019, Zhang and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2020). It occurs in Doi Inthanon National Park in Thailand. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but is unlikely to be large. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species.
