{"name": "157866313", "result": [{"species_id": 157866313, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents along the East Pacific Rise in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from eight restricted locations in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 2,200 m to 2,845 m bsl. The species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields and has a restricted AOO, suggesting that it would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. Given that all known locations fall within International Waters with no conservation measures in place, we have opted to assess the species as NT.<br/><br/>Whilst no licences have been granted to date, if mining were to be approved within any of these locations, this species is projected to experience decline in the extent and quality of its habitat.&#160;The presence of the species across a large geographical area owing to the spread of hydrothermal vent fields across ocean ridges might give cause for LC, however, this vent species is endemic to vent environments and only occupies a small area of suitable habitat (~32 km\u00b2) which is significantly below the VU category threshold for AOO under criterion B. Therefore, it would only take a small number of mining events to drive the species to extinction and a&#160;reassessment would be merited in the event of mining licences being granted, whereby the species would be capable of becoming VU B2ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to eight locations at hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise in the Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2,200 m bsl to 2,845 m bsl. All eight hydrothermal vent locations, which include the following vent fields, occur beyond national jurisdiction in International Waters: EPR 13\u00b0N (Location 1), EPR 9\u00b050'N (Location 2), EPR 7\u00b025'S (Location 3), EPR 14\u00b0S (Location 4), Rehu-Marka (Location 5), Animal Farm (Location 6), Rapa Nui (Location 7) and EPR 48'S Axial Dome (Location 8) (McLean 1988, Dreyer 2004, Blake 2006, Matabos <em>et al</em>. 2011). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (McLean 1988, Dreyer 2004, Blake 2006, Matabos&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2,200 m to 2,845 m bsl.", "threats": "The eight locations in which this species is found all fall within International Waters and are subject to International Seabed Authority (ISA) governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. There are currently no deep-sea mining licences granted for vent fields within the East Pacific Rise or Gal\u00e1pagos Rift. However, the ISA has granted numerous exploration licences to date in other areas like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, so there is reason for concern.&#160;ISA exploration-phase licences allow some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing. Both direct impacts from mineral extraction and indirect disturbance from adjacent activities could impact local subpopulations. Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al. </em>2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. These vent fields would be susceptible to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining is permitted. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al. </em>2018). We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licences to be granted as a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at any of the eight vent fields inhabited by this species. We recommend that specific national/international legislation is required for the protection of deep-sea habitats and resources. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the East Pacific Rise.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
