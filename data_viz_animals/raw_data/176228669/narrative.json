It has a restricted distribution with an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 714 km<sup>2</sup>. There is only one location known based on various threats that are leading to a continuing decline in the habitat quality. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is known only from the type locality (Boeseman 1968). From the original description the holotype is said to have originated from the surroundings of Paramaribo, while Weber<em> et al.</em> (2012) consider this locality as erroneous. The current assessment however is based on the premise that Paramaribo is the type locality in absence of better information.", "population": "Weber<em> et al.</em> (2012) refrained from reviewing the species arguing that it is not a <em>Hypostomus</em> but a <em>Squaliforma</em> instead. On the other hand, Ray and Armbruster (2016) avoided reviewing it in its treatment of the genera <em>Squaliforma</em> and <em>Isorineloricaria</em> arguing that it is a species of <em>Hypostomus</em> instead. In sum, the species has not been reviewed since its original description, and only the holotype is known.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "No specific habitat information is known for this species.", "threats": "The type locality is under environmental disturbance from various threats related to human development and agriculture.", "conservationmeasures": "No specific conservation actions are known for this species.", "usetrade": "No uses are known for this species."}]}
