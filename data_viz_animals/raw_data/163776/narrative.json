The species should also be looked for in Myanmar. Only three locations have been recorded in Thailand and one in Yunnan; the latter is in the Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are inferred to be declining to at least some degree due to loss and degradation of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 8,772 km\u00b2. With only four locations known and a relatively small EOO, the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it is hoped that when additional information becomes available, a reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Planaeschna chiengmaiensis</em> is known from Yunnan (Zhang 2019) and Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in the northwest of Thailand (Asahina 1981, 1985; Katatani <em>et al</em>. 2004).
