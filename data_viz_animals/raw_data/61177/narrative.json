{"name": "61177", "result": [{"species_id": 61177, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it is only known from a single location: Chizumulu Island.&#160;It meets the area requirements under criterion B1 for Critically Endangered and it is known from one location based on the threat of collection. However, future declines in habitat quality or population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of aquarium trade and sedimentation on this species are unknown and it is therefore listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it is only known from Chizumulu Island.", "population": "No information is available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is observed in the upper part of the sediment free rocky shore habitat on the more exposed shores, at a mean depth of five metres. It feeds in a horizontal position biting off loose algae from the rock surface. Its pointed snout allows it to penetrate narrow spaces and cracks inaccessible to other fishes. Territorial males are seen throughout the year defending their territories aggressively against all intruders. Some females move around solitary while others are territorial. Spawning occurs inside the male's cave, which consists of a shelter between some rocks. The maximum growth size is 11 cm.", "threats": "Irregular extraction for aquarium trade and sedimentation are two potential threats.", "conservationmeasures": "No information is available on conservation actions for this species.", "usetrade": "It is irregularly collected by the ornamental fish trade where it is known by its scientific name."}]}
