At least two locations are within protected areas (Bach Ma and Chu Mom Ray National Parks). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its current known minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 23,125 km\u00b2. With the available data, cases can be made for Vulnerable (VU D2), Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B1ab(ii,iii)) or Least Concern (range of minimum and maximum EOO larger than 20,000 km\u00b2). Given that the habitat requirements of the species are not well understood and the minimum EOO is not much larger than the Vulnerable B1 threshold, Least Concern is probably not an appropriate assessment at this time. The species is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B1ab(ii,iii)). It is to be hoped that when more data on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance become available, a reassessment to Least Concern will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Idionyx asahinai</em> is only known from five localities in Viet Nam (Karube 2011, Karube <em>et al</em>. 2020).

Usually reports for genus <em>Idionyx</em> are abundant in females, but males are rarely seen. For this species, only three males are reported. Their reproductive behaviour is poorly known, almost all specimens were flying in a deforest area near a small river, especially in the late afternoon.\u201d Nothing else appears to have been recorded and little can be inferred from the above information, since <em>Idionyx </em>species often fly in clearings in the late afternoon, although most or all of them are forest-dependent.
