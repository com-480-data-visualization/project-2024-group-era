No further information exists for this species. Based on these records, it has an area of occupancy (AOO) of 8 km<sup>2</sup>. This species could be threatened by contamination from mining  activities, and change in hydrological regimes due to climate change. There are two locations and an inferred continuing decline in habitat quality based on these threats. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is known from only two sites in Uruguay in the Lower Uruguay ecoregion (according to Abell <em>et al.</em> (2008)). Records are based on the original description (Lucinda <em>et al.</em> 2006) since there are no further records for it.", "population": "No information is available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It has been recorded in a stream and a marginal lagoon. It may be an omnivorous species. It is a viviparous species, but there is no further information about its reproductive biology.", "threats": "This species could be threatened by contamination from mining activities, and change in hydrological regimes due to climate change.", "conservationmeasures": "This is a problematic species from the taxonomic point of view. Although considered valid by Fricke <em>et al. </em>(2020), comparisons with the related and sympatric species <em>Cnesterodon decemmaculatus </em>cast doubts over its identity. Further research is recommended.", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
