{"name": "149850612", "result": [{"species_id": 149850612, "taxonomicnotes": "<em>Channa gachua</em> has been misapplied to this species. The Sri Lankan population  (<em>Channa kelaartii</em>) is different from Indian population (<em>Channa gachua</em>)  (Conte-Grand <em>et al.</em> 2017).", "rationale": "<em>Channa kelaartii</em> is an endemic species in Sri Lanka and has a wide distribution throughout the island in both the dry and wet zone from the lowland to mid hills. Due to an Area of Occupancy (AOO) less than 284 km<sup>2</sup> and being distributed in 15 locations, we believe that the species should be listed as a Near Threatened (NT) species.", "geographicrange": "<em>Channa kelaartii</em> is endemic to Sri Lanka. It has been recorded throughout the country except in very high montane areas (De Silva <em>et al. </em>2015).", "population": "The species is common across Sri Lanka, although there is not sufficient information about its population trends. However, it is possible to infer a decline in its populations owing to natural system modifications, pollution and climate change.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>The range of this species is found in association with low country marshes and mid country hill streams. Adults inhabit medium to large rivers, brooks, rapid-running mountain streams, marshes, swamps and stagnant water bodies, including sluggish flowing canals. Individuals are found in both clear and murky water bodies (Senanayake 1980, Pethiyagoda 1991, De Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p>", "threats": "The species is threatened in parts of its range by habitat loss and degradation, pollution from agricultural run-off including nutrients and pesticides and droughts induced by climate change.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions implemented for this species.", "usetrade": "The species is not very popular as food source among people. There are no recent records of export for the aquarium trade, although this has occurred in the past (Gunasekara 2011)."}]}
