{"name": "184630", "result": [{"species_id": 184630, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is currently only known for certain from Lake Kyaninga, a small crater lake. It has a current area of occupancy (AOO) of 4 km\u00b2. Currently, there is a single location based on habitat due to erosion and silting from agriculture and water pollution. The habitat is declining based on this threat. Therefore, it is assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species originally was reported from two (unspecified) crater lakes at Fort Portal, south-west Uganda (Mandhal-Barth 1954). There is also a historical record from the Ruizi River near Mbarara, where the species is now considered Possibly Extinct due to the poor condition of the river and a lack of recent records. Extensive malacological surveys in western Uganda since 2010 have provided a single specimen of this species collected alive in 2015 at Lake Kyaninga, Fort Portal (C. Albrecht pers. obs. 2015), hence this lake is considered to represent the current extant distribution of this species.", "population": "There is no population information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species lives on leaves of aquatic plants. It has been recorded from crater lakes and the Ruizi River.", "threats": "This species faces a declining quality of habitat due to erosion and silting from agriculture and water pollution.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no information available on conservation actions in place for this species. It is only known at a single location and as such, conservation plans for the lake should include future monitoring for this species.", "usetrade": "There is no use or trade information for this species."}]}
