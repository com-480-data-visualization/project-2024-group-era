However, more than half of the records date from the colonial period. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining to at least some degree along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely not much more than 20,000 km\u00b2; the minimum estimate, including all of the older records, is just under 22,000 km\u00b2. Given that its EOO is not far above the 20,000 km\u00b2 threshold for Vulnerable under critreion B1, and inferred declines in AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat, the species is close to qualifying for Vulnerable. Therefore, taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, the species is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B1ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that as more data become available, a reassessment to Least Concern might become possible for this species.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rhinocypha heterostigma</em> is endemic to Java where it is known from western and central parts of the island (Baskoro 2018, Fraser 1926, Lieftinck 1934, Schmidt 1934).
