Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 14,179 km<sup>2</sup>. Total population size and population trend are unknown, but the species appears dominant in at least one collection locality. Continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred, based on the presence and documented impacts of deforestation, urbanization, agricultural production, industrial processing, and pollution. However, uncertainties regarding the scope and magnitude of existing threats on each known collection locality, and potential sampling bias associated with limited ichthyological collections since the time of description prevents an accurate estimate of the number of threat-based locations where this species occurs.

The Piriqui River basin is influenced by intensive farming areas, artificial pastureland, urbanization around large population centres, and industrial processes associated with dairy production (Cavalli&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Agricultural products in this region include soybeans, corn, wheat, sugarcane, and cassava (Cavalli&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Threats in the Iva\u00ed River basin include sewage waste and subsequent eutrophication, destruction of riparian forests as crop production and cattle ranching expands, and soil erosion associated with agricultural production (Frota&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Routine releases of captively produced fingerlings (e.g., <em>Leporinus</em>, <em>Piaractus</em>, <em>Pseudoplatystoma</em>, <em>Prochilodus</em>, <em>Salminus</em>) may have negative effects on existing native fisheries (Frota&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>  <p>Hydroelectric infrastructures are present throughout all major tributaries of the Paran\u00e1 River, and may negatively impact aquatic habitat by preventing dispersal, increasing sedimentation, and regulating natural hydrological processes (Frota&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Cavalli&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Climate change may exacerbate existing impacts by creating warmer and dryer conditions, with less predictable rainfall and more extreme weather events (Castello and Macedo 2016).</p>  <p>Despite uncertainties regarding the direct impact of widespread land-use change throughout the upper Piquiri, and Iva\u00ed River basins, containing decline in habitat quality is inferred.
