An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species.

The assessor is aware of records from more than 11 locations but it has only been possible to assign separate coordinates to eight of these for mapping purposes. The species occurs in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area, which may gain totally protected status, and might also occur in the nearby Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its known extent of occurrence (EOO) is less than 20,000 km\u00b2. The EOO based only on the eight data points referred to above is 9,929 km\u00b2;&#160; the EOO based on known occupied HydroBASIN areas is 18,880 km\u00b2.</p>", "population": "<p>Judging from the number of specimens in the M\u00fcller collection, this species can be common where it occurs. Beyond this, all that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is suspected due to loss of lowland forest in Palawan and its satellite Islands and that severe fragmentation is very likely for the same reason.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Virtually nothing has been recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it will be a species of lowland forest, probably confined to stream habitats. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threat to this species will be from deforestation resulting from agriculture and logging. BirdLife International (2019, but based on information from 2001) note (for Palawan in general) that \u201cSmall-scale timber extraction and well-organised logging operations are hastening the depletion of the forest cover on the island\u201d, this is despite the fact that the entire island is a Biosphere reserve.\u201d There is little forest remaining on Dumaran and most of the forest cover visible on Cuyo in satellite images appears to actually be coconut plantations and farms.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more information on its distribution, habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Total protection of additional areas in Palawan where the species occurs (for instance Cleopatra\u2019s Needle) and any remaining habitat on Dumaran and Cuyo is highly desirable.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
