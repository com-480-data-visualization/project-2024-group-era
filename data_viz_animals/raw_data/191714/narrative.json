It was historically reported from the endorheic R\u00edo Grande de Morelia basin including the Lago Cuitzeo, and the Presa Cointzio, from the Laguna Yurir\u00eda and several spring areas (La Mintzita, La Maiza, San Cristobal) draining into the R\u00edo Grande de Morelia respectively Lago Cuitzeo. It is furthermore known from the endorheic Laguna Zirahu\u00e9n and Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro basins, from the R\u00edo Angulo drainage including the Lago Zacap\u00fa and from habitats along the Middle R\u00edo Lerma, at least from a spring near San Francisco del Rinc\u00f3n, R\u00edo Turbio drainage and from the R\u00edo Laja system. There is one report from this species from the Presa El Centenario near Tequisquiap\u00e1n, R\u00edo San Ju\u00e1n drainage (a R\u00edo P\u00e1nuco affluent); it even reached the headwaters of this river. The distribution and abundance of&#160;<em>Skiffia lermae</em>&#160;has declined steadily over the last 50 years with continued losses through the 2000\u2019s. The species has disappeared from the Laja River, Lake Yurir\u00eda and the entire Lake Zirahu\u00e9n basin, and has become uncommon and limited to a few small springs in the Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro and Grande de Morelia River basins (Lyons&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Soto-Galera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, 1999, De la Vega-Salazar 2003, Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, 2008, Mercado-Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). At present, only about six sites remain, the largest of which are in Lake Zacap\u00fa in the Lerma River basin, the Molino de Chapultepec Springs in the Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro basin, and the La Mintzita Springs in the Grande de Morelia River basin (Lyons 2011). Studies have found a&#160;55% reduction in the historical distribution of the Olive Skiffia (Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><span><span><span><span class=\"st\"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>", "population": "The species was historically widely distributed, but has been extirpated through water pollution and competing non-native fish from several drainages. The Laguna Yurir\u00eda and the R\u00edo San Ju\u00e1n subpopulations have been eradicated. The Middle R\u00edo Lerma subpopulation survived in a spring in San Francsico del Rinc\u00f3n until the recent years, but was finally extirpated through introduced Sunfish and Largemouth Bass. A survey by Lyons (2015) revealed a single female, while three suveys by K\u00f6ck <em>et al.</em> in 2017 found no specimens (M. K\u00f6ck&#160;pers. comm. 2018)&#160;. The Laguna de Zirahu\u00e9n subpopulation was also extirpated by the Largemouth Bass, decades ago. The Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro subpopulation only remains in a spring near Chapultepec, although the numbers seem to be stable. The R\u00edo Angulo subpopulation is not known from outside the Zacap\u00fa lake; it also seems to be stable in the lake. Finally, a few springs within the R\u00edo Grande de Morelia drainage are populated with the Olive Skiffia. It was still known from few sections of the Lago Cuitzeo a couple of years ago (O. Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez pers. comm. 2014), but seems to be absent since that time. All of the spring habitats display moderate numbers of fish, some of the stocks are under pressure from non-native competing fish species (e.g. Green Swordtails and Guppys in La Mintzita) and water extraction.<br/><br/><br/><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<em>Skiffia lermae </em>occurs in quiet waters of lakes, spring-fed ponds, canals and  small creeks with clear to turbid water over mud, sand, gravel and  decayed organic matter. The vegetation comprises green algae, <em>Eneichhornia</em>, <em>Lemna</em>, <em>Scirpus</em>, <em>Salvinia</em>, <em>Nasturtium</em> and <em>Potamogeton</em> (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2005). The gut of this species is long and convoluted and it often grazes on algae and aufwuchs. Though also attracted by insects falling on the surface, this species is a herbivorous representative of the Goodeids.<br/><br/>La Mintzita is a marshy spring-fed lake, of about 80 m diameter, that  drains       into the R\u00edo Grande de Morelia and hence into the Lago  Cuitzeo. The R\u00edo Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo basin is endorheic, although  its       fauna indicates that it was once connected to the adjacent R\u00edo  Lerma       basin. Most of the R\u00edo       Grande de Morelia/Cuitzeo  system has been greatly degraded, and La       Mintzita is one of the  last remaining high-quality sites in the basin. A few hundred metres  below the lake, the outlet canal receives       wastes from a large paper  mill (Bio Papel Scribe S.A. de C.V.) and no longer has the capability  to support       fish life, so La Mintzita is isolated from other fish  populations in the       basin. Lyons (2004) sampled the  outlet canal just below the lake, with a       backpack  electroshocker, and the lake itself just above the outlet with a        seine. The canal  was about       8 m wide and 0.5-1 m deep, with a  fast strong current and  gravel bottom. In 80 m of sampling, they collected the following  Goodeids: 3 <em>Alloophrous       robustus</em>, 30 <em>Goodea atripinnis</em>,       about 100 <em>Xenotoca </em>cf. <em>variata</em>, 5 <em>Skiffia       lermae</em>, and about 15 <em>Zoogoneticus       quitzeoensis</em>. They also       caught 10 <em>Poeciliopsis infans</em> (Poeciliidae; native) and about 25 <em>Xiphophorus       helleri</em> (an exotic Poeciliid), plus 10 <em>Yuriria       alta</em> (Cyprinidae; native) and 10 <em>Scartomyzon       austrinus</em>. They then pulled       the seine over about 300 m<sup>2</sup>   in the lake, which       averaged about 1 m deep with a sand and clay   bottom and clear water at       15-19 \u00b0C temperature. They captured 3  <em>A. robustus</em>, 5 <em>G. atripinnis</em>,       30 <em>X. </em>cf. <em>variata</em>, about 100 <em>S.       lermae</em>, 3 <em>Z. quitzeoensis</em>, plus at least 1,000 <em>P. infans</em>, 5 <em>X. helleri</em>,       and 30 <em>Y. alta</em> (Lyons 2004).<br/><br/><em>              </em>The  spring in Chapultepec, Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro drainage, is an egg shaped and  fenced in spring with two  effluents, one on the south end, one on the west end. The size is  approximately 100 x 50 m, the depth from observations  outside of the  fence is at least 1.5 m. The effluents are channels from  about 80 cm (south-channel) to  more than 1 m (west-channel) width. Both channels  have sandy ground with  gravel and several rocks on the borders. In  recent years (2014-2017),  submersed vegetation in the channels occurred  in the form of some floating  water hyacinths directly after the outlet in  the south and areas with dense<em> Egeria</em>  sp. stocks. Grassy riparian  vegetation covered the borders and hung over the surface, while the west-channel  was partly covered by trees. At the&#160; west-outlet, some exotic <em>Zantedeschia</em> species grew along with the borders and shaded it partly. This part of the channel was densely planted with<em> Egeria</em>   and had a depth of 1 m. After 120 m from the outlet, it is dammed, leaving the   subsequent part of the channel with a varying depth between 15 and  40 cm.  The current in both channels was fast to moderate, the water  looked  characteristic milky blue, probably to dissolved minerals. The   vegetation in the spring itself was composed of <em>Egeria</em> species and <em>Potamogeton</em>   species. The water parameters taken in March 2017 were: water temperature, 19.5\u00b0C; pH, 7.22; conductivity, 1,180\u03bcS. Other fish species associated with the Olive Skiffia  were <em>Allotoca diazi</em>, <em>Goodea atripinnis</em>, <em>Alloophorus robustus </em>and<em>&#160;</em><em>Allotoca dugesii</em>. <br/><br/>The Lago Zacap\u00fa is an irregularly shaped small lagoon with an extension  from the northwest to the southwest, a length of about 670 m and width of about 470 m. In the southwest corner of the lake begins the dammed outlet, extending east-north-east upward over a  length of about 800 m and 60 m wide, over the whole length. The outlet  ends with a southwards bent hook, with an extension of 150 x 90 m. After  the dam, the affluent of the Canal or R\u00edo Angulo begins and merges into  it after about 6.5 km. K\u00f6ck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017)  found the species was abundant within two sites of the lagoon, at shallow depths within the free water column (M. K\u00f6ck&#160;pers. comm. 2018).  The water was greenish brown in one place but clear, with little current  and partly shaded by tree. In another part, it was brown to clear, also showing little to no current. Other species found at the first spot were <em>Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis</em>,&#160;<em>Xenotoca variata</em>,&#160;<em>Goodea atripinnis</em>,&#160;<em>Allotoca zacapuensis&#160;</em>and<em>&#160;Hubbsina turneri. </em>The same species were found<em>&#160;</em>at the second site, except for the Zacap\u00fa Allotoca. <br/><br/>The  Lago Zacap\u00fa is fed by approximately 20 cold water springs (19 \u00b0C), which  emerge at the southwestern end of the valley of Zacap\u00fa: some are used for human consumption and recreation (Ramsar Secretariat, Site  No.1465, 2004). With the confluence of fish species, migratory  birds, plants and endemic amphibians (<em>Ambystoma andersoni</em>), it  can also be considered as a broad transitional zone, giving it great  ecological importance. The two main sections of Lago Zacap\u00fa differ: one has depths of between 4 to 6 m, and the other ranges from 12 to 90 m deep,  bedded by soils and alluvium (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1465, 2004).", "threats": "The species is threatened by water pollution from urban sewage, agricultural run-off, invasive species competition (mainly from Poeciliid species) and predation, in addition to over-extraction of water resources for human consumption and irrigation.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions for <em>Skiffia lermae</em> are known, but it occurs at three Ramsar sites: P\u00e1tzcuaro lake (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1447, 2005), La Mintzita spring (Ramsar Archive, Site No.1919, 2009) and Lago Zacap\u00fa (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1465, 2004). <br/><br/>The only conservation effort is a monitoring and <em>ex-situ</em> breeding project run by the Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Acuatica in Michoacan University, Morelia, Mexico", "usetrade": "The Olive Skiffia is not used for human consumption and is not a target species for the ornamental fish trade."}]}
