The assessors have seen records from at least 24 individual sites, however most of these records date from the colonial period; there are far fewer recent records and probably fewer than 10 locations that can really be considered as currently known. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, but with the available information the AOO is unlikely to be greater than 2,000 km\u00b2 and could very well be considerably less. Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining to some degree along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and pollution of habitat across Java. Its extent of occurrence is well above the criterion B1 thresholds. Despite the relatively large (for a Javan endemic) EOO, the relatively few currently known locations for this species are a cause for concern and given the inferred declines in AOO etc. and the fact that even in the best case the AOO is unlikely to be much greater than 2,000 km\u00b2, the species is best assessed as Near Threatened because it is close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion B2 (nearly meets VU B2ab(ii,iii)). It would qualify for Vulnerable if the AOO was known to be under 2,000 km\u00b2 and the overall population was severely fragmented. It is to be hoped that as more data become available, a reassessment to Least Concern might become possible for this species.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Neurobasis florida</em> is endemic to Java, with records from across the island (e.g. Baskoro <em>et al. </em>2018, Lieftinck 1934, Orr and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2007, Pamungkas <em>e al. </em>2016, Ris 1912, Schmidt 1934, Setiyono <em>et al. </em>2017).
