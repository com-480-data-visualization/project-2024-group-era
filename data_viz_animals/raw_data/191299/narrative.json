{"name": "191299", "result": [{"species_id": 191299, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Yuriria chapalae&#160;</em>is a freshwater fish species endemic to Lake Chapala, a protected area Ramsar Site in the Lerma/Santiago Basin, located between the states of Jalisco and Michoacan, Mexico. It is also found in Rio Grande de Santiago, above the falls and holds a population within the Guaracha Dam, in Chapala Lake Basin.&#160;The species is threatened by over extraction of water resources, agricultural, urban and industrial pollution, dams and competition and predation from introduced invasive alien species. These threats are causing a continuing decline in the quality of its habitat. It has a restricted distribution (EOO = 2,770 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>) and it occurs in two locations, based on the main threat affecting its population. This species is thus assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Yuriria chapalae </em>is a freshwater fish species endemic to Lake Chapala, a protected area Ramsar Site, in the Lerma/Santiago Basin located between the states of Jalisco and Michoacan and is the largest lake in Mexico (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1973, 2008). It is also found in Rio Grande de Santiago, above the falls (Miller 2005) and holds a population within the Guaracha Dam, in Chapala Lake Basin (Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007). The extent of occurrence is estimated at 2,770 km<sup>2</sup>, including the area of Lake Chapala and the sub-catchment where the Guaracha Dam is located. <br/><br/>The Rio Grande de Santiago (or Rio Santiago) flows out of Lake Chapala, through the states of Jalisco and Nayarit and is an extension of the Rio Lerma. Rio Santiago flows generally northward and westward, receiving the Verde, Juchipila, Bola\u00f1os, and other tributaries. It descends to the coastal lowlands and empties into the Pacific Ocean 16 km northwest of San Blas, in Nayarit.", "population": "More information is needed about the population size and trend of <em>Yuriria chapalae</em>.
