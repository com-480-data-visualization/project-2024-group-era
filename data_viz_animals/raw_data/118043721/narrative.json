{"name": "118043721", "result": [{"species_id": 118043721, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is listed as Vulnerable, in view of its extent of occurrence (EOO) of 19,929 km<sup>2</sup> with all observed individuals in three threat-based locations. There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat related to urbanization and agriculture. It is necessary to conduct more sampling to determine the area of occupancy (AOO) and to estimate the populations size and trend.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from small ponds in three localities: Chichiriviche, Miranda near the coast of the Caribbean Sea, and Bachaquero near the coast of Maracaibo Lake.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate the population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species has been collected in brooks and ditches near the central coast of Venezuela (Meyer and Radda 2000).", "threats": "All subpopulations are in areas that have been considerably altered by urban development for residential areas and infrastructure for tourism, including houses and commercial sites. This is particularly evident in the subpopulations on the coasts of Valencia state (Oliveira-Miranda<em> et al.</em> 2010). Part of its distribution area in the Maracaibo lake basin consists of semi-deciduous forests that are under threat from log extraction and deforestation for the settlement of small-scale farms (Hern\u00e1ndez-Montilla <em>et al. </em>2010).", "conservationmeasures": "One of the three known subpopulations, representing around 30% of the entire population, occurs within Cuare Refuge for Wildlife. This species would benefit from habitat restoration and better information on distribution, abundance, population trend and threats.", "usetrade": "It is unknown whether this species is traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
