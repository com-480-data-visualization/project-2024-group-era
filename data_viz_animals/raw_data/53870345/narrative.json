There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat related to deforestation, fires and small farms. However, there is insufficient information on threats in order to count locations for this species. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is known from Guiana Shield and has only been collected in the Ichun River and its tributaries, that drain the upper Paragua River, in the Caron\u00ed River Basin, Bol\u00edvar state.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate the population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It occurs in marginal pools of small creeks with clear waters with sandy to muddy bottoms and abundant leaf litter. Water conditions are: temperature of 24\u00b0C, acidic (pH 4.8-5.2), high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (7.4 mg/l) and low conductivity (16 ms/cm) (Lasso-Alcal\u00e1 <em>et al.</em> 2006).", "threats": "The main threat for this species is represented by the deforestation of tropical forests because of log extraction, fires and the settlement of farms (Oliveira-Miranda<em> et al.</em> 2010).", "conservationmeasures": "Around 65% of the population occurs within Natural Monument Cerro Ichum.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded for ornamental purposes.
