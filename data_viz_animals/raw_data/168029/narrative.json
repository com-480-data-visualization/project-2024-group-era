The scant available evidence suggests that the species is dependent on primary forest for its survival and threats exist to all such forest (even in protected areas) in Luzon. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but the AOO is unlikely to be large and with the available data is almost certainly below 2,000 km\u00b2 and may well be less than 500 km\u00b2, and will be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across northern Luzon. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely to be less than 20,000 km\u00b2. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under both the B1ab and B2ab criteria and is assessed accordingly. </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Luzonobasis glauca</em> is only known from the north of Luzon Island in the Philippines, its distribution is summarized&#160;in Villanueva (2012). Five locations are known but the assessor has only been able to assign separate coordinates to four of these for mapping purposes. At least one of the locations is within the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but the AOO is unlikely to be large and with the available data is almost certainly less than 2.000 km\u00b2 and may well be less than 500 km\u00b2<sup> </sup>and will be declining due to loss and degradation of forest across northern Luzon. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely to be smaller than 20,000 km\u00b2 (EOO is somewhere between 8,539 and 28,263 km\u00b2 (based on the area within a minimum convex polygon around the known localities and around the occupied HydroBASIN areas).<br/></p>", "population": "<p>This does not appear to be a particularly common species. Beyond this all that can be said with the available data is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss and degradation of forest in northern Luzon.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Very little is known on the habitats and ecology of this species. Villanueva (2012: 586) states \u201cThe present materials available were collected in primary forest. One male encountered in Palanan, Isabela Province was caught in the forest with no nearby water source, suggesting the possibility that this genus breeds in phytotelmata\u201d. The material available to Villanueva (2012) included all that had any habitat information associated with it. Whilst it is quite possible or even likely that the species breeds in phytotelmata, this needs to be confirmed. The extent and quality of suitable habitat are certainly declining due to loss and degradation of forest across northern Luzon.</p>", "threats": "<p>Threats to this species exist even within the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park: \u201cLogging, agricultural encroachment, the use of destructive fishing and hunting methods, and the conversion of wetlands form major threats to the biodiversity of the protected area. Government plans for infrastructural development and mining could have a severe impact on the park\u201d Villanueva <em>et al. </em>(2009: 72). The same threats will exist at non-protected sites.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>Additional data on distribution, habitat requirements, ability to tolerate disturbance and threats are urgently needed for this species.
