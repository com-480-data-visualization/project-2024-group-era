{"name": "125922809", "result": [{"species_id": 125922809, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Cubanichthys pengelleyi</em> is restricted to lowland drainages in southwestern Jamaica. Extent of Occurrence is estimated to be 163 km<sup>2</sup>. Population size is unknown. Population trend is suspected to be declining. Local and regional threats to freshwater habitat include agricultural, urban, and industrial pollution, the establishment of non-native species, deforestation and land-use changes associated with urban and tourism development, and mining activities. These threats are producing inferred continuous declines in habitat quality, habitat availability, and in the number of mature individuals. As such, <em>C. pengelleyi</em> is assessed as Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii,v). Additional ichthyological surveys may reveal a broader distribution and a greater number of threat-based locations.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cubanichthys pengelleyi</em> is endemic to Jamaica (Briggs 1984, Rauchenberger 1988, Lara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), where it has been reported from six collection sites in the lowlands of the Black River drainage on the southwestern side of the island in St. Elizabeth Parish (GBIF 2020). </p>  <p>Extent of Occurrence is estimated to be 163 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2020). While this is likely to be an underestimate associated with limited ichthyological sampling in Jamaica, it is unlikely that additional sampling effort would result in an estimated EOO greater than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Given occurrence in one major river drainage that is subject to a number of anthropogenic threats (NEPA 2006, Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), this species is inferred to occur in a single threat-based location. </p>", "population": "<p>The total population size of this species is unknown. Population trend is suspected to be in decline, given recent reports of mass fish kills in the Black River drainage associated with high levels of pesticide pollution (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species inhabits shallow (1.5 m) clear waters (pH 8.2) with a sandy bottom and some soft patches of silt. <em>C. pengelleyi </em>typically hides among submerged or floating aquatic vegetation and feeds on&#160;damselfly and dragonfly nymphs, other aquatic larvae, ostracods, copepods and snails.&#160;Eggs measure 1.2-1.4 mm in diameter and hatch in about 9 days (Lee&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1983).", "threats": "<p></p><p>Freshwater habitat degradation is prevalent throughout Jamaica (NEPA 2006). The Hope, Swift, Wag Water, Cobre, Yallahs, Minho, Buff Bay, Oracabessa, Morant, and Grande Rivers have been deemed in critical condition by the Jamaican government and associated water management units (John 2006). The most recent version of the Jamaican National Environmental Action Plan cites prevalent regional threats related to pollution originating from a number of agriculture, urban, and industrial inputs, alterations to natural flow hydrology due to damming infrastructure, artificial reservoirs, and agricultural irrigation infrastructure, and sedimentation of natural waterways (NEPA 2006). Alluvial mining is a major localized threat to aquatic habitat quality and biodiversity in the Yallahs and Minho rivers (Weeks&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). The Montego River and North Gully are associated with a number of anthropogenic pollutants, including trace metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls associated with agricultural and industrial production (Jaff\u00e9&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Bauxite mining, limestone quarrying, road construction, and illegal settlements continue to impact remaining pristine habitat in the island's interior (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Mining pressures are expected to increase in future years, thereby increasing deforestation and process waste (NEPA 2006). Tourism presents a significant threat to the future integrity of coastal and lowland habitat (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</p>  <p>Currently, less than 10% of Jamaica is covered by intact primary forest, and few lowland and coastal habitats remain undisturbed (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). According to a 2006 report, approximately 75% of Jamaica\u2019s freshwater resources (John 2006) and 40-50% of Jamaica\u2019s land area is allocated to agricultural production (Mitchell 2016). Primary agricultural products include poultry, yams, and sugar (Josling&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Use of the organochlorine pesticide endosulfan to control agricultural pests in coffee production has resulted in background levels that are present in freshwater ecosystems, sediments, fish, and shrimp, though runoff events into freshwater habitat are typically sporadic (Ellis-Tabanor and Hyslop 2007). Mass fish die-offs associated with pesticide pollution have been recently reported in the Black River (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</p>  <p>Tilapia production began in Jamaica in the early 1950s and was initiated by the Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture\u2019s Fishery Division (Cooke and Mooyoung 1983). Historic cultivation of <em>Oreochromis mossambicus</em>, and continuing cultivation of <em>O. niloticus</em> has resulted in establishment of both species throughout most of Jamaica\u2019s natural freshwaters (Cooke and Mooyoung 1983). As of 2001, approximately 526 hectares of aquaculture ponds facilitated the production of Tilapia in Jamaica (Morrison and Vogel 2009). The direct impact of Tilapia establishment on native ichthyofauna in Jamaica has not been studied in detail. Three species of Poeciliids (<em>Poecilia reticulata, Xiphophorus helleri</em>, and <em>X. maculatus</em>) are established in freshwater drainages in Jamaica (Geheber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), but their impact on native ichthyofauna is unknown. The non-native Three-Spot Gourami (<em>Trichogaster trichopterus</em>) has been reported from a single drainage on the northern coast of the island with no evidence of reproduction when it was collected (Geheber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;There are numerous other species which have become established in the islands river systems. These include the Amazon Sailfin Catfish<em> Pterygoplichthys pardalis</em>, <em>Hoplosternum</em> sp., and <em>Parachromis managuensis</em>, to name a few (Jones 2014).</p>  <p>Future climate change is expected to increase incidences of drought and stronger storms, affecting land-use patterns and water supply systems (Mitchell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p><br/><p></p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p></p><p>Multiple protected areas are established in Jamaica, including the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park, The Cockpit Country, Dolphin Head Mountain, and Hellshire Hills (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020). While primary forest remains intact throughout a majority of these park boundaries, habitat degradation continues, due primarily to illegal logging activities (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Currently, this species is known only from the Black River Lower Morass which is a designated Ramsar site, but is still severely impacted by agricultural production (e.g., sugarcane and marijuana) (Hailey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</p>  <p>Additional research regarding distribution, population size, population trend, and the scope and magnitude of threats would be useful in clarifying the conservation status of this species.</p><br/><p></p>", "usetrade": "This species is not utilized in any commercial capacity."}]}
