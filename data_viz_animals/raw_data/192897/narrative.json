{"name": "192897", "result": [{"species_id": 192897, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>The species is endemic to the lagoons of the Laguna de la Media Luna area and the upper Rio Verde (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005). A continuing decline of the species' habitat quality has been observed as a result of over-extraction of water resources, pollution and introduction of invasive alien species. The species extent of occurrence is approximately 3000 km<sup>2</sup>, with 3-5 locations based on the most plausible threats. Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered. <br/><em></em></p>", "geographicrange": "<p>Endemic to the lagoons of the Laguna de la Media Luna area and the upper Rio Verde (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>", "population": "By 1954, collections by Mr. Gregg showed that in \"La Laguna de la Media Luna\" and its surroundings,&#160;<em>Herichthys bartoni</em>&#160;was in association with six species:&#160;<em>Astyanax fasciatus mexicanus</em>,&#160;<em>Dionda rasconsis, Ictalurus mexicanus, Herichthys labridens, Ataeniobius toweri</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Cualac tessellatus</em>. In addition, in the lagoon, &#160;<em>H. bartoni&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>H. labridens&#160;</em>constituted 80% of the collections (40% each), while in the channels both species were only surpassed in abundance by&#160;<em>Astyanax.</em>&#160;Therefore, by the middle of the 20th century, although the distribution of&#160;<em>H. bartoni&#160;</em>was limited to the Rio Verde valley, this mojarra was one of the two most abundant species within it (Miller 1956).&#160;This situation changed in 2006, since these cichlids only reached 3.6 and 11% in the lagoon (Palacios-Nu\u00f1ez <em>et al</em>. 2010), while in 2017, in the lotic systems around the lagoon, they were two of the three least abundant and frequent species (Soto-Galera <em>et al.</em> 2018).", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species inhabits clear, sulfurous lagoons, marshes, canals, small streams (water easily muddied), in moderate to slight or no current, with substrates of firm sand, flocculent silt, organic matter, clay, mud, marl, rock, and some boulder. Vegetation may be sparse but is usually common, including green algae, water hyacinth, water lilies (<em>Nuphar</em> sp.), <em>Scirpus</em>, and a dense, unidentified, broad-leaved submergent. It is found in depths to 1.5 m or more, more commonly 1 m. In La Media Luna the water parameters are: salinity 1.3 ppt, conductance 1930 \u03bcmhos\u00b7cm\u0304\u00b9. Water temperatures are 26\u00b0-30\u00b0C in spring-fed habitats and 20\u00b0C in R\u00edo Verde in late November (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p>", "threats": "<p>The springs in the desert area suffer from environmental pressure because of the demand for water for human use. This has led to the disappearance of many of the springs, with the consequent extinction of the species found in them. It is only a matter of time before the reserves of the water tables are unable to maintain the water levels in the bodies due to the large amount of water extracted, which will force them to ration their use, or stop their extraction for a period of time, with the consequent bankruptcy of human activities. The aquifer may be restored over time, but the fauna could disappear. On the other hand, it is necessary to be aware of the danger of introducing exotic species, since these could harm the habitat in other ways. Beyond the ecological wealth and the beauty that these species represent, it is important to understand that evolutionary and geological processes continue (Artigas-Azas 1994). Additionally, the lotic systems of the \"R\u00edo Verde\" basin show severe symptoms of environmental deterioration, as a result of modification and their contamination by urban waste, garbage, agrochemicals and fertilizers. In a study of the fish community of La Media Luna Lagoon, Palacio-Nu\u00f1ez&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010)&#160;found an impact of Tilapia (<em>Oreochromis</em>&#160;sp.) on native fishes, due to niche overlap.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "It is necessary to plan of projects that allow use of water for the human populations surrounding the lagoons of the Valley, while ensuring adequate levels of water for the permanence of the aquatic communities. Enactment of laws that impede the access of people inside the lagoons is important, since these are used as recreational places and to practice diving, which directly affects the quality of the water and deteriorates established vegetation on the walls and edges of the lagoon and springs.", "usetrade": "This species is not utilised."}]}
