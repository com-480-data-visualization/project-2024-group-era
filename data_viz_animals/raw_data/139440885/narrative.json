Although a relatively large number of locations are known for the species it is believed that the overall population is declining and severely fragmented. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it may not be particularly large (could be below or close to 2,000km<sup>2</sup>) and is inferred to be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, due to loss of forest and pollution of forest streams within the range of the species. The species would qualify for Vulnerable status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) if its AOO was known to be below 2,000km<sup>2</sup> and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cyrano angustior</em> is endemic to the Philippines where there are records from Camiguin, Dinagat, Leyte, Mindanao and Samar (Cayasan <em>et al</em>. 2013, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 1989, personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.
