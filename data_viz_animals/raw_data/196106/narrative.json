Its estimated Extent of Occurence (EOO) is 255 km<sup>2</sup> and its Area of Occupancy (AOO) is 28 km<sup>2</sup>. A continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat has been observed as a result of water pollution by agrochemicals and increased sedimentation from the neighboring tea plantations. These type of threats are likely to continue in the future as the area is undergoing agricultural expansion and there is no protection of the majority of its habitat. Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Rasbora naggsi</em> is an endemic freshwater fish species, recorded only from Pambahinna, near the village of Belihul-Oya in the  Walawe River  drainage, within the south-central intermediate zone of Sri Lanka (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2010).", "population": "There is no information available about the population size and population trends for this species which is a rare species in the island. A decline in its population may be inferred on the basis of the threats this this species faces owing to decline of habitat quality.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species is found in fast flowing, shaded streams with boulders and sandy substratum (De Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015).", "threats": "This species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation resulting from water pollution by agrochemicals and increased sedimentation from the neighboring tea plantations.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no specific conservation actions in place for this species.", "usetrade": "There is no information available on the use or trade of this species."}]}
