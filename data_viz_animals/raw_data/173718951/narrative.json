An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, however it is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest and other threats within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is likely &lt;20,000 km\u00b2 (EOO = 8,073\u201321,803 km\u00b2). The species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)).
