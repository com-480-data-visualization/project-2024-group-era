Given uncertainties in distribution, Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be between 2,157-12,040 km<sup>2</sup>. Total population size and population trend are unknown. Potential threats include deforestation, agricultural expansion, mining activities, and road infrastructure development within the Darien region. While the scope and magnitude of these threats are unknown, they are having inferred negative impacts on habitat quality.
