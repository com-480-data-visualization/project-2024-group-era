However, although its true AOO cannot be accurately calculated with the currently available information, even if other populations exist (likely), there is no reason to suppose that the AOO exceeds 500 km\u00b2; it is likely to be considerably less than this.

The species is assumed to be very rare; however, published reports of surveys of areas of similar habitat in Hainan are lacking.
