None of the known locations appears to lie within a protected area. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. It is plausible that the extent of occurrence (EOO) is less than 20,000 km\u00b2. If the species was known to be severely fragmented it would qualify for Vulnerable status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and it is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Risiocnemis praeusta</em> is known from Biliran, Dinagat, Leyte, Panaon and Samar in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 1991, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.

The AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) falls at least partly within the 20,000 km\u00b2 threshold for Vulnerable B1 (EOO is somewhere between 18,188 and 24,976 km\u00b2, based on the area within a minimum convex polygon around the known localities and around the occupied HydroBASIN areas).<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"></p>", "population": "<p>This appears to be a moderately common species across much of its range.
