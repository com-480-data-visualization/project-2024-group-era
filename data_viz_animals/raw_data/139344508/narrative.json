An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible, but with the available data it is unlikely to be large (possibly below 2,000 km\u00b2, but this needs to be confirmed). Moreover, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its known extent of occurrence (EOO) is much larger than the criterion B1 thresholds. Despite the large EOO, there are some causes for concern over this uncommon and locally occurring species. If the AOO was known to be below 2,000 km\u00b2, the species would qualify for Vulnerable under criterion B2. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B2ab(ii,iii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Chlorogomphus infuscatus</em> is only known from China where there are records from six localities (Needham 1930, Zhang 2019, unpublished).
