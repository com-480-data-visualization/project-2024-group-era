These bodies of water are ~ 95 km apart and recent surveys in western Cuba in 2019 failed to detect this species in additional sites (S. Rodr\u00edguez-Machado, pers. comm. 2020). Therefore, <em>R. berovidesi</em> has an estimated Area of Occupancy (AOO) of 8 km<sup>2</sup>. Predatory alien fish species represent the main direct threat to the species, along with erosion due to livestock and agriculture, which results in a continuing decline in the species habitat quality, at least in one of the two known localities. Considering an extremely limited distribution, two known threat-based locations, and continuing decline in habitat quality associated with invasive species and land-use change, <em>R. berovidesi</em> is assessed as Endangered under criterion B2ab(iii). However, given that this species was described as recently as 2015, additional studies and further ichthyological sampling will be useful in clarifying the conservation status of this species. </p><br/><p></p>", "geographicrange": "<p></p><p><em>Rivulus berovidesi</em> is known only from its type locality, a small stream in the Sierra de Cajalbana, and a second collection locality in the Camarones River, both of which are situated in Pinar del Rio province, northwestern Cuba (Rodriguez Silva 2015).
