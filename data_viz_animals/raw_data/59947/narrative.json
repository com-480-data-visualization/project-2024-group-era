A survey carried out between November 2001 to January 2002 has shown that <em>Oreocnemis phoenix</em> Pinhey, 1971 is still abundant on the plateau of Mount Mulanje and that it is not present in other highlands in Malawi and adjacent Mozambique, where suitable habitat appears to be largely absent (Dijkstra 2005). Although subpopulations are apparently healthy at present, habitat is threatened by drainage and habitat destruction due to agriculture, encroachment and  overexploitation of forest, and mining. Based on these threats less than five locations are estimated.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Mount Mulanje, 1,800 to 2,200 m Asl, in south Malawi.", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "Montane streams (1,800 to 2,200 m Asl).", "threats": "Drainage and destruction of swampy habitats. Mt Mulanje was gazetted as a  forest reserve in 1927. However, serious cases of encroachment and  overexploitation of forest resources have become a problem and available  resources are currently inadequate for its protection. Mining is also considered a threat. Based on these threats less than five locations are estimated.", "conservationmeasures": "No information available but research into conservation measures and trends/monitoring of the species would be valuable. Enforcement of habitat and site-based actions are also required.", "usetrade": null}]}
