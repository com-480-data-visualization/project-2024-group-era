The species has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 788  km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 88 km<sup>2</sup>. As there is insufficient information available on either a population  decline or the effect of ongoing habitat degradation on this species, it  is assessed as Near Threatened based on its limited distribution.  Monitoring of the population trends for this species is required to   determine whether there is evidence of population declines as a result   of the ongoing threats in the lake. This species is a candidate for  Endangered, if there is sufficient evidence of the effects of the  observed declining quality of habitat on the species.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>", "geographicrange": "<em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Corbicula matannensis </em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">is  endemic to the Malili Lakes (Sulawesi), where it occurs widely in Lake Matano and Lake Mahalona, and with a single known population in Lake Towuti (Glaubrecht <em>et al.</em> 2003, von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).</span>", "population": "There is no population information available for this species because there are little survey data to determine trends.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in freshwater lakes and dwells in soft substrates such as sand or mud (von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018).", "threats": "The populations of this species in Lakes Mahalona and Towuti are likely to have suffered due to habitat decline caused by pollution from nickel mining and water regulation due to hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. In addition there are observed declines in quality of habitat due to threats from siltation from soil erosion and water pollution from organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes. However, in both cases the impacts on this species are unknown. Finally, this species is facing a major potential threat from the invasive Flowerhorn cichlids (<em>Colossoma</em> sp.) which occurs in Lake Matano. These invasive species have unknown but potentially serious consequences (Herder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), as&#160;<em>Corbicula&#160;</em>may form a significant part of their diet (Herder<em>&#160;</em><em>et al</em>.&#160;in prep.).&#160;Flowerhorn cichlids&#160;have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and they are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona.&#160;The effect of the invasive species on&#160;<em>C. matannensis</em>&#160;needs to be investigated.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no known conservation actions currently in place for this  species. Further research into the impact of the invasive species on  the endemic bivalves is recommended, as well as the impacts of pollution  and siltation within the lakes. Monitoring of the population trends  for this species is required to determine whether there is evidence of  population declines as a result of the ongoing threats in the lake.", "usetrade": "This species is occasionally consumed locally."}]}
