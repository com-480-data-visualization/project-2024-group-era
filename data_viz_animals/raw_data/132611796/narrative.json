The population size and trend are unknown. Based on the very small number of locations (less than 5), and its restricted distribution, <em>Astyanas ocotal&#160;</em>could be assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2 (e.g. Jelks <em>et al.</em> 2006 considered it Threatened). However, given that there it isn't experiencing a continuing decline, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "<em>Astyanax ocotal</em> is endemic to an endorheic highland basin and adjacent rivers, Lake Ocotal, Lake Metzabok and R\u00edo Tulij\u00e1 in northern Chiapas, Mexico (Schmitter-Soto 2017).", "population": "More information is needed on the population size and trend of <em>Astyanax ocotal.</em>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<em>Astyanax ocotal</em> is endemic to highland freshwater lakes and adjacent rivers. Little is known of this species' habitat preferences or ecological role and more information is needed. This species has a maximum size of 105.1 mm (SL) (Schmitter-Soto 2017), and the elongated snout and stronger teeth suggest a more piscivorous diet than other <em>Astyanax </em>species.", "threats": "The lake populations of this species are protected and far from human settlements. However, the river Tulij\u00e1 faces severe pollution from sewage effluents upstream (Ruiz-Sibaja <em>et al.</em> 2015). Under the name \"<em>Bramocharax </em>sp.\", <em>Astyanax ocotal</em> has been listed as Threatened by the American Fisheries Society's Endangered Species Committee (Jelks <em>et al.</em> 2008), based on the criterion of its very restricted distribution.", "conservationmeasures": "There are currently no species-specific conservation actions directed towards&#160;<em>Astyanax ocotal</em>.
