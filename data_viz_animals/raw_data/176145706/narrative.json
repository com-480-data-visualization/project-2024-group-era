Its its area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 4,580 km\u00b2, but its extent of occurrence&#160;(EOO) is best estimated at 5,027 km\u00b2, which meets the criterion B1 threshold for Vulnerable. There are local impacts in the Kuribrong River and Potaro River due to small legal and illegal gold mining operations, representing at most four locations (B1a), depending on the mine dredges dimension. Mining activities in the Kuribrong River are causing declines in the AOO (b(ii)), but it is currently unknown whether the population size is affected. There are also continuing declines in the habitat quality (b(iii)) in both basins, although the Kuribrong is more affected by the impacts. It should be noted that the distribution of the species in the Potaro drainage is around the Kaieteur National Park, a no-mining zone that should be protected under the laws of Guyana. However, it is reported by the Guyana Natural Resource Ministry that there are frequently illegal mining activities in the national park area that have been challenged by the authorities in Guyana.&#160;Additionally, there is a hydroelectric plant project (Amaila Falls) in the region of Kuribrong River about 5 km from the locality of the subpopulation of <em>Tatia meesi</em>, that was stopped. However, due to its rheophilic habits of living in rapids and cataract environments, this species is likely to be severely impacted if the hydroelectric plant is built in future. Thus, it is recommended to monitor mining activities in the Kuribrong River both above and below the plateau, as well as in the right bank of Potaro River along the border of the Kaieteur National Park to continually assess the impacts of legal and illegal activities and any possible dam construction in order to determine whether fish populations are stable or change over time. Thus, <em>Tatia meesi</em> is assessed as Vulnerable (VU) due to the restricted distribution and persistent impacts of gold mining activities. It is recommended to investigate the status of its population, since the species is not well known, and if the species is found to occur more widely, the assessment should be revised.</p><p></p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Tatia meesi&#160;</em>is known only from the type locality in the&#160;Waratuk&#160;cataract,&#160;Potaro River, and from two additional localities in the rapids of Kuribrong River, both Essequibo basin, Guyana. The best estimate of the extent of occurrence&#160;(EOO) is 5,027 km\u00b2, and although this is the upper end of the estimate range, it represents the areas where the species probably occurs. The area of occupancy (AOO) is between 16\u20134,580 km\u00b2, with 4,580 km\u00b2 being the best estimate.&#160;This best estimate represents the expected distribution of the species (slightly larger than the currently known distribution), including other small creeks of similar types within its extent of occurrence. This species needs specific collection methods and probably is undersampled and underrepresented in scientific collections. However, it is known only from the blackwater tributaries of the Kuribrong, and in the Potaro River drainage from a distributional range limited to the cataract at Tumatumari and waterfalls at Waratuk. Its overall distribution is apparently restricted to these areas of the basin. More field work is needed to collect specimens in other localities in order to better understand the true range of this species.<br/><p></p>", "population": "<em>Tatia meesi </em>is currently known in the Potaro River drainage from a distributional range limited to the cataract at Tumatumari and waterfalls at Waratuk. Geographic features such as large cataracts and waterfalls can prevent the dispersal of organisms living either side of those features and function as important barriers to gene flow. Hardman <em>et al.</em> (2002) also reported the Tumatumari and Kaieteur falls&#160;to be a distribution&#160;for of 33 other species in this portion of Potaro drainage. This species is rare in scientific collections due to the difficulties of collecting it in its habitats.

However, it is reported by Guyana natural resource Ministry&#160;that there are frequently illegal mining activities inside the National Park area.
