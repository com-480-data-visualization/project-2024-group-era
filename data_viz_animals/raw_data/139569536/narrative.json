An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However the area of Polillo is less than 630km<sup>2</sup> and since not all habitat on the island will be suitable for the species the AOO can safely be assumed to be less than 500km<sup>2</sup>. Similarly the Extent of Occurrence of the species is constrained by the area of Polillo and will be less than 5,000km<sup>2</sup>. Ongoing declines in AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat are inferred from loss of forest on Polillo and with only two locations known the species qualifies for Endangered status under criteria B1ab(ii,iii) and B2ab(ii,iii) and, taking a reasonable precautionary approach, is assessed accordingly. Additional data from Polillo may allow re-assessment to a lower threat category in future, but given the small AOO, EOO and definite threats it is very unlikely that Least Concern status will ever be appropriate (and therefore Data Deficient is not an appropriate assessment at present) unless the species is found on other islands in the Philippines.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta wildermuthi</em> is known from two locations on Polillo in the Philippines (Villanueva 2010a, 2010b, Villanueva &amp; Schorr 2011).

Villanueva (2010b: 6) states that two males were \u201cin a shaded portion of an irrigation canal\u201d so it seems that the species can occupy modified or artificial habitats if they are sufficiently well shaded. The extent and quality of suitable habitat is inferred to be declining due to loss of and disturbance to forest on Polillo.</p>", "threats": "<p>The most recent information available to the assessor on threats to Odonata on Polillo is in Villanueva (2010a: 21): \u201cPolillo Island lacks high mountains and deep gorges which hinder clearing for agricultural purposes. This makes the island at threat to land conversion for agriculture and settlement. During the survey several tracts of forest are cleared for agricultural reasons mainly through \u2018kaingin\u2019 [slash and burn]. In some instances clearing extends to the creeks or streams removing vegetations that provide cover for shade loving species.</p>  <p>Deforestation, as always the prime threat to Philippine species, is also present in the island. Though logging concessions are no longer a present threat, large number of small scale logging threatens the remaining forest patches. This logging activity was noted during the survey even in the watershed sites. \u2026</p>  <p>Use of pesticide for collecting crustacean not only on the site it is applied at but, of course, downstream as well. This intentional poisoning of the water system, in addition to the pesticide from agricultural lands, threatens not only livestock and people downstream but the entire aquatic organism. Unfortunately, this practice is rampant not only in Polillo but also in various areas in the country.\u201d</p>  <p>Examination of satellite images supports much of the above text and <em>Drepanosticta wildermuthi</em> appears to be under threat from deforestation from agriculture and small scale logging and possibly also from pollution.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more data on exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance and for protection of habitat where the species occurs is highly desirable. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
