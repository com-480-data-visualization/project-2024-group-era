Whilst within protected areas, the upper area of the Plateau is less  than 20,000 km\u00b2 and the species is assessed as Vulnerable based on an area of occupancy of 28 km\u00b2 and three locations). Nothing is known on the  biology of the species and it is assumed to be rather habitat specific and range-restricted. More  surveys are needed to check how the species' range is restricted, if  there are any past, present and/or future threats and if conservation  measures are necessary. Its  status should be reassessed if further survey reveals a wider  distribution, or upgraded if specific threats discovered.", "geographicrange": "Pseudagrion symoensii is only recorded from two localities in the  Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Kundelungu and Upemba NP) and it is assumed to  be endemic to the southern tip of the plateau.", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species was recorded from the Katwe River \"near Cyperus beds\".
