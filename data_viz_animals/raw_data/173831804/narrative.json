{"name": "173831804", "result": [{"species_id": 173831804, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Gymnotus capitimaculatus</em> is known only from the Rio do Ouro, a tributary of the Jucuru\u00e7u River in Bahia state, Brazil. Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>. This species is assigned to a single threat-based location based on documented impacts to habitat quality associated with riparian deforestation and cattle ranching. Continuing decline in habitat quality at the type locality is inferred. Therefore, <em>G. capitimaculatus</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). Targeted ichthyological sampling along the Rio do Ouro is urgently needed to clarify range extent, population size, and population trend. Determining the scope and direct impact of localized threats is an immediate research priority.", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Gymnotus capitimaculatus</em> is known only from its type locality Rio do Ouro, a tributary of the Jucuru\u00e7u River in Itamaraju municipality, Bahia state, northeastern Brazil (Rangel-Pereira 2014, Ferraris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The current distribution is likely a relict population of a formerly larger range, and comprehensive ichthyological sampling will be necessary to determine if additional collection localities exist (Rangel-Pereira 2014).</p>  <p>Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a 2x2 km grid overlain on the type locality where it has been reported (Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The type locality of this species is impacted by riparian deforestation and land-use change associated with cattle ranching (Rangel-Pereira 2014), and therefore it is assigned to a single threat-based location (Rangel-Pereira 2014). </p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown.
