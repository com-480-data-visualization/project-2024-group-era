{"name": "117850739", "result": [{"species_id": 117850739, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it occurs in the southeastern arm. It meets the area requirement under criterion B for the threatened categories and it is known from six locations based on the threat of sedimentation. This part of the lake experienced the severest decline in visibility and light penetration caused by increasing sedimentation/turbidity. This species relies on algal growth in the somewhat deeper regions of the rocky habitat. It is unclear as to whether there are continuing declines. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it is restricted to the rocky habitats along the western shore of the southeastern arm, from the northern tip of Domwe Island to Makokola Reef.", "population": "<em>Tropheops kumwera</em>&#160;is a common species within its range.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "<em>Tropheops kumwera</em> occurs in rocky habitats among small and medium-sized rocks, with a depth distribution from 3 m to at least 40 m. Males are only weakly territorial, while females are not and non-territorial individuals are solitary. It feeds on blue-green algae that are picked from the rocky substrate and on plankton when such is available in sufficient quantities. Mouth-brooding females hide between rocks and are rarely seen. Maximum total length is about 9 cm.", "threats": "Sedimentation and extraction by the ornamental fish trade are potential threats.", "conservationmeasures": "The majority of the distribution is in the Lake Malawi National Park.", "usetrade": "It is irregularly collected by the ornamental fish trade where it is sometimes known as \"Pseudotropheus Elongatus Boadzulu\"."}]}
