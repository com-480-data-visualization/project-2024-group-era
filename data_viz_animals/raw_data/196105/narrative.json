It's estimated Extent of Occurence (EOO) is 4.2 km<sup>2</sup> and its Area of Occupancy (AOO) is 4 km<sup>2</sup>. A continuing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat has been observed as a result of deforestation due to the expansion of tea plantations, leading to water pollution by agrochemicals and siltation. Considering all these factors, the species is currently facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Therefore, it is assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Rasbora armitagei</em> is an endemic freshwater fish species recorded only from Weralugahamulla, near Rakwana in the Kalu River drainage of the wet zone of Sri Lanka (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2010).", "population": "There is no population data available for this rare species. It can be inferred, however, that this species faces a decline in population numbers owing to habitat degradation caused by threats such as pollution.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "Found in shady, slow-flowing clear water streams with gravel and boulder substrata.
