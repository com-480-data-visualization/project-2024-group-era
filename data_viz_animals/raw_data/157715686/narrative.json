{"name": "157715686", "result": [{"species_id": 157715686, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from two restricted locations, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 1900 m to 2699 m bsl. As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted AOO and EOO, and has been found at two locations, the plausible threat of future anthropogenic influence from deep-sea mining in these sites justifies the assessment of the species as VU D2. Whilst no licenses have been granted to date, if mining were to be approved within the Tonga EEZ, the projected decline in the extent and quality of habitat would drive this species to CR very rapidly. Therefore, an urgent reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining license arrangements or if there are future changes to the prices of relevant commodities, whereby the assessment would probably increase to EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii).&#160;A reassessment would also be merited if a moratorium on deep-sea mining is reached by the government of Tonga, whereby the assessment would be likely to decrease to NT or LC.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to two locations at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes would smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. Both locations lie within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Tonga. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1900 m bsl to 2699 m bsl. It has been observed from two vent fields at separate locations: at the Hine Hina vent field (Location 1) and the Tow Cam vent field (Location 2) (Waren and Bouchet 1993, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2010). The species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields. The two vent fields are distributed over a Minimum Convex Polygon area of 506 km<sup>2</sup> in the Indian Ocean.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Waren and Bouchet 1993, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2010).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1900 m to 2699 m bsl.", "threats": "The Hine Hina and Tow Cam vent fields lie within the Tonga Exclusive Economic Zone and are not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulfide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al.</em> 2018). There are currently no deep-sea mining licenses granted within the EEZ of Tonga. However, as they are not subject to international governance and legislation, these vent fields would be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining were to be permitted. This is particularly concerning for developing countries where there may be limited capacity to undertake appropriate environmental impact assessments and develop and enforce environmental laws to manage deep-sea mining activities (Hoagland <em>et al</em>. 2010). Furthermore, there is currently no protection, such as marine protected areas, in place for these vent fields, leaving the window open for Tonga to consider the future implementation of mining licenses. We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licenses to be granted as a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at any West Pacific Ocean vent fields. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites in the Lau Basin.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
