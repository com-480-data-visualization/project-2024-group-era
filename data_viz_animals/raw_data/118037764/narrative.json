{"name": "118037764", "result": [{"species_id": 118037764, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Even though it has a wide extent of occurrence (EOO), the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is small (36 km<sup>2</sup>). It only occurs in two rivers, which are very far from each other, hindering any chance of a rescue of the subpopulations from the Caura River by those in the Cataniapo. Its habitats in the lower Caura have been altered due to mining activities and a continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred in this part of the range. However, it is not possible to count locations across the entire range. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is known from the Guiana Shield. It is present in the Cataniapo river in Amazonas state, and in the Caura River in Bol\u00edvar state.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate athe population size, although this species occurs in high densities in small patches in the littoral regions of rivers.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is present in rivers and floodplain lakes with highly acidic waters (pH 5.61-5.82, conductivity 12-20 us/cm<sup>3</sup>) (Mesa and Lasso 2013).", "threats": "The subpopulation in the Caura River is threatened because of log extraction and water pollution related to gold mining (Oliveira-Miranda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). There are three illegal gold mines within the distribution area of the population within the Lower Caura River (Sanchez 2015), affecting this subpopulation through habitat loss and degradation.", "conservationmeasures": "Only the subpopulation in the Caura River is present in a protected area, represented by the national park that encompasses the basin of this river. However, there is a need for improved habitat protection at sites where it is known to occur.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded in the ornamental fish market."}]}
