No subpopulations are distinguished.", "rationale": "<em>Allotoca meeki&#160;</em>is only known from the endorheic Laguna de Zirahu\u00e9n drainage, where it has been extirpated from the lagoon by non-native, predatory Black Bass species. The last known habitat is the Estanque de Condempas in Opopeo in the headwaters of the R\u00edo El Silencio, the main source for the lagoon.&#160;Taking into consideration a single known location, declines in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, quality of habitats and population, in addition to several threats; the species is assessed&#160;Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "The Zirahu\u00e9n Allotoca is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Michoac\u00e1n. It is endemic to the endorheic Laguna de Zirahu\u00e9n basin. It historically occurred in the Laguna and in the Estanque de Condembas (Lago de Opopeo) in the town of Opopeo (about 14 km east of the lagoon), its waters flowing into the R\u00edo El Silencio -&#160;the main source of the Zirahu\u00e9n lagoon. The species disappeared from the lagoon in the 1990's but persisted (despite the presence of the predacious Largemouth Bass:&#160;<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) in the spring fed lake in Opopeo and its effluent. An evaluation of the distribution of the&#160;Zirahu\u00e9n Allotoca highlighted the disappearance of this species from more than the 65% of its historical range (Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).", "population": "This species was once common in the Zirahu\u00e9n lake basin. The introduction of two non-native predatory species of the Black Bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides </em>and<em>&#160;M.&#160;</em><em>punctulatus</em>) in 1933 eliminated the Goodeid species from the lake by the late 1990s  (Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez <em>et al</em>. 2005). A population of this species&#160;persisted in the Estanque de Condempas in Opopeo in the headwaters of the main tributary of the Zirahu\u00e9n lake, the R\u00edo El Silencio, but by the 2000\u2019s, bass had invaded this lake and no <em>Allotoca meeki</em>  could be found there in 2011. Three individuals were  encountered in a small shallow outlet of the lake, but the prospects for  the long-term survival of the species in this outlet were bleak (Lyons 2011). In 2014, the situation remained the same, with few individuals in the outlet. However, a survey in 2017 by K\u00f6ck <em>et al.</em> found&#160;<em>Allotoca meeki</em>&#160;(and <em>Goodea atripinnis</em>) in the spring fed pond in Opopeo, despite presence of Black Bass of up to 30cm.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<em>Allotoca meeki </em>was&#160;known to occur within the Laguna de Zirahu\u00e9n, a freshwater lake of approximately 9.8 km<sup>2</sup>. This lake is a deep mountain lake with a sandy bottom, partially covered with mud and extending over an area of 970 hectares (2,400 acres) with a volume of 0.216km\u00b3. This water body is the centre of the endorheic Laguna de Zirahu\u00e9n basin, and has been stocked with predatory Black Bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em> and <em>M.&#160;</em><em>punctulatus</em>) since as early as the 1930's. These species caused the extirpation of the Zirahu\u00e9n Allotoca from the lake, in addition to several other native Goodeid species.&#160;<br/><br/>The Estanque de Condempas in Opopeo, about 13 km east of the lake, is currently the only known habitat of this species. This spring fed and dammed pond is triangle shaped with a long side of 190 m and two shorted sides of 110 and 130 m. The spring is on the southeast angle of the longer side, the outlet on the northwest angle. The pond is encompassed by walls, the water reaching down to a depth of 1 - 1.5 m. The bottom is muddy and structured by big rocks, the walls and the shore have dense mats of <em>Eichhornia</em> and other plants with floating leaves. Close to the spring, the water is not deeper than 0.5 m and partly overgrown with dense grass. During a survey by K\u00f6ck <em>et al. </em>in 2017, <em>Allotoca meeki</em> was found only in the vegetation. In the free water, schools of Black Bass could be seen, some reaching 30 cm in length. The Zirahu\u00e9n Allotoca was also found in the outlet, a fast flowing shallow creek, not deeper than 20 m and not wider than 80 cm. It had a sandy bottom with rocks, the shore densely covered with riparian vegetation. The species was found under floating leaves or between dense vegetation. Like in the pond&#160;<em>Goodea atripinnis </em>was also found,&#160;but no Black Bass were seen. The beginning of the outlet is used for washing laundry. The water parameters as of November 2017 were: water temperature (17\u00b0C); pH (7.87); conductivity (982 \u03bcS).<em> Allotoca meeki,&#160;</em>like all <em>Allotoca</em> species, is mainly carnivorous and feeds on small invertebrates.", "threats": "The main threat for this species are predatory non-native Black Bass. In 1933, under the Mexican president Abelardo L. Rodr\u00edguez, two species of the genus&#160;<em>Micropterus (salmoides </em>and <em>punctulatus</em>) were introduced into the P\u00e1tzcuaro and Zirahu\u00e9n lakes. While these species seems to have disappeared again from the P\u00e1tzcuaro lake&#160;within the last two decades, they still persist in the Zirahu\u00e9n lake. They eliminated almost all native Goodeid species (<em>Allotoca dugesii</em> and <em>A.&#160;</em><em>meeki</em>, <em>Skiffia lermae</em> and <em>Alloophorus robustus</em>) from the lake, except <em>Goodea atripinnis. </em>They have been introduced to a spring in the main source of the lake, the Estanque de Condempas, and have eliminated at least <em>Alloophorus robustus </em>from there too. <em>Goodea atripinnis</em> and <em>Allotoca meeki</em> survived as remnant populations, but the presence of the Black Bass mean that the Zirahu\u00e9n Allotoca is still under enormous pressure by these large predators.<br/><em></em>", "conservationmeasures": "The Zirahu\u00e9n Allotoca is included in the international <em>ex-situ</em> breeding project \"<em>Allotoca</em>-Mesa Central\" from the Austrian Association of Aquarists (\u00d6VV\u00d6) for all species of the genera<em> Allotoca</em> and <em>Neoophorus</em> (http://www.oevvoe.org/allotoca-mesa-central).
