Extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is assigned to a single threat-based location. Total population size and population trend are unknown. Primary localized threats at the type locality include land-use change associated with cattle ranching and plantation agriculture. While the direct impact of these threats at the type locality are not well understood, their expansion could feasibly result in the extirpation of this species within the immediate future. Well-preserved and potentially suitable habitat occurs in seasonally flooded areas in the neighbouring region to the north, but has to date received limited sampling effort. As such, <em>C. roseus</em> is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2. </p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cynolebias roseus</em><strong> </strong>is known only from its type locality, a remnant temporary pool near the town of Barra in the left-bank floodplain of the S\u00e3o Francisco River (Costa 2014). However, well-preserved seasonally flooded areas occur in the neighbouring region to the north, and may provide suitable habitat in poorly accessible areas that have received little sampling attention (Costa 2014). </p>  <p>Despite uncertainties in range extent and the need for additional ichthyological surveys, Area of Occupancy (AOO) and Extent of Occurrence (EOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup> based on a single 2x2 km grid overlain on top of the type locality (Costa 2014). This species is assigned to a single threat-based location, given a restricted distribution that is surrounded by cattle ranches and plantation agriculture (Costa 2014).

While the direct impact of these activities at the type locality are not well documented, their expansion could feasibly result in the extermination of all suitable habitat at the type locality over a short period of time if they are not actively mitigated. Relatively well-preserved seasonal ponds occurs northward, and are free from major anthropogenic threats (Costa 2014).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>C. roseus</em>, nor has the species been reported from within the boundaries of any existing protected areas. Additional ichthyological surveys in potentially suitable habitat north of the type locality are urgently needed to clarify the conservation status of this species. Additional information regarding population size, population trend, and the direct impact of localized threats at the type locality would be useful in clarifying extinction risk. Site protection and captive management are likely warranted conservation priorities, given the pervasive threat of agricultural expansion that could result in the complete loss of temporary pond habitat in the immediate future. &#160;</p>", "usetrade": "<p>There is no information regarding the use and trade of this species. </p>"}]}
