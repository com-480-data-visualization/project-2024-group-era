It remains extant at three threat defined locations; Chawia Forest, Ngangao Forest and Mbololo Forest fragments. There is ongoing decline in quality and extent of habitat as a result of threats ranging from clearing of  indigenous forest trees and shrubs for firewood, building poles and  forest fires. Extended drought periods are also a threat. The species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)).", "geographicrange": "The species is restricted to the indigenous forest fragments of Taita Hills Kenya, part of Eastern Arc Mountains (Larsen 1996, Wagura 2014, Kioko <em>et al</em>. 2021). The species has occurrence records from Chawia Forest, Mbololo Forest and Ngangao Forest.", "population": "The current population trend is not studied.
