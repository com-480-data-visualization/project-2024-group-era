These localities represent only one threat-based location, which is threatened by pollution and sedimentation from increasing urbanisation. Historically this species was found down to 21 m, but recent surveys in the deeper littoral and profundal zones did not yield any live specimens of this species. It was also recorded in Mbamba, Zambo and Monkey Bay in Mandahl-Barth (1972), but was not found there in recent surveys. This species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi. It seems to be rare and has been found recently only at two localities near Nkhotakota. It has been dredged from substrate down to 70 feet (21 m).<br/><br/>It was also recorded in Mbamba, Zambo and Monkey Bay in Mandahl-Barth (1972), but was not found there in recent surveys.&#160;The surveys during the last decade have been predominantly carried on the Malawian side of the basin, with foci in the north as well as central and southern parts of the lake. The Tanzania shoreline has only occasionally been visited, whereas the part belonging to Mozambique has largely been ignored.", "population": "There is no population information available for this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is found on sandy and slightly muddy littoral substrates within Lake Malawi.", "threats": "Increasing urbanisation threatens this species through pollution and sedimentation from domestic, agricultural and industrial sources.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species,&#160;but research into its population size, threats and ecology is needed.", "usetrade": "There is no information available on the use or trade of this species."}]}
