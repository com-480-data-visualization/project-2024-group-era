Historical area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is known from a single threat-based location. A past population reduction of 100% is inferred to have occurred between 2010-2017 due to the total loss of the type locality which was drained and landfilled. Surrounding potential habitat in the Carna\u00edba de Dentro River drainage is extensively modified for agriculture, and deforestation of riparian buffers remains a major threat for extant congeners that only occur in shaded portions of temporary pools. Additional ichthyological surveys are urgently needed to determine if this species is extant in surrounding temporary ponds that may provide suitable habitat.

The site has since been destroyed by construction and no suitable habitat remains (Costa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).
