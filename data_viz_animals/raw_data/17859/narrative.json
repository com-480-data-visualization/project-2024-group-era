The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Vulnerable under Criterion D2.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Northern Cape Province in South Africa, occurring on the northern Namaqualand coast between Noup in the south and Port Nolloth in the north.", "population": "Known from nine subpopulations. There is no information currently available on population size and trends.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in coastal sand dunes.", "threats": "Diamond mining at Kleinsee and urban development at both Port Nolloth and McDougall\u2019s Bay have caused past habitat loss in the past and also pose a future potential threat to this taxon.", "conservationmeasures": "The southern portion of the distribution range is situated in a restricted diamond-mining area. Efforts should be made to ensure that current and future mining activities do not endanger the known colonies. Urban development at Port Nolloth and McDougall\u2019s Bay should be monitored.", "usetrade": null}]}
