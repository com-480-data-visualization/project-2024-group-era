{"name": "6153", "result": [{"species_id": 6153, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Cyprindon fontinalis</em> is currently restricted to Ojo Solo, a small and failing spring system in the Samalayuca Basin, Chihuahua, Mexico. Groundwater over-extraction and surface water diversion for agricultural use threaten the persistence of suitable habitat, which has desiccated by over 70% in recent years. While conservation efforts have successfully established a secondary population at Ojo Caliente, the range and total population size of <em>C. fontinalis</em> are still extremely small. Given demonstrated and continuing habitat loss resulting from water resource use, two locations where this species occurs, an estimated Extent of Occurrence (EOO) of 10.9 km<sup>2</sup>, and an estimated Area of Occupancy (AOO) of 16 km<sup>2</sup>, <em>C. fontinalis</em> is listed as Endangered. </p>", "geographicrange": "<p></p><p><em>Cyprinodon fontinalis</em> historically occurred in 8-9 springs within Desierto de Samalayuca basin, Chihuahua, M\u00e9xico (Carson and Maza-Benignos 2014). It is currently restricted to Ojo Solo (an impounded spring within the Guzman drainage basin) northwest of Villa Ahumada resulting from desiccation of historical habitat (Carson <em>et al</em>. 2015, Lozano-Vilano and Maza-Benignos 2017). Recent conservation efforts have resulted in an established population at Ojo Caliente, a 0.3 km<sup>2</sup> spring north of Ojo Solo (Carson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is a maximum of 10.9 km<sup>2</sup>, and estimated area of occupancy is 16 km<sup>2</sup>, including the population established at Ojo Caliente (Carson <em>et al.</em> 2015). The number of locations is defined as two.&#160;</p><p></p>", "population": "The total population size of <em>C. fontinalis </em>is unknown, but expected to be small, given its severely restricted range. Conservation efforts collected 955 individuals from Ojo Solo over a two day period in 2014 (Carson and Maza-Benignos 2014). Population trend is in decline due to habitat loss resulting from groundwater extraction in adjacent areas. Less than 30% of the historical habitat of this species remains, and declines are expected to continue into the immediate future if excessive pumping does not cease (Loazno-Vilano and Maza-Benignos 2017).", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species occurs at Ojo Caliente, in water approximately 27 <sup>o</sup>C at the outflow source, with moderate to no current and at depths to 1 m. Aquatic macrophytes and algal vegetation are present. Its reproductive period is thought to be extended, given consistent water temperature throughout much of the year (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005).", "threats": "<p>The primary threat to <em>C. fontinalis</em> is the loss of remaining habitat as a result of groundwater extraction and surface water diversion in adjacent areas, primarily for agricultural usage (Carson and Maza-Benignos 2014, Lozano-Vilano and Maza-Benignos 2017). Approximately 30% of Ojo Solo remains. Additionally, the western mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia affinis</em>)&#160;is established in Ojo Solo (Lozano-Vilano and Maza-Benignos 2017).

In 2014, 835 individuals were translocated from Ojo Solo to Ojo Caliente, where the subpopulation has successfully established (Carson and Maza-Benignos 2014, Carson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>A captive breeding program is underway at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium (Carson and Maza-Benignos 2014).</p>", "usetrade": "This species is not utilized."}]}
