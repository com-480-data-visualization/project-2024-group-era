{"name": "170899", "result": [{"species_id": 170899, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species is endemic to Greece, where it occurs on Kasos Island (Aegean Sea). It is known from at least five localities, including phryganic areas outside caves and only locality inside a cave. It has a small area of occupancy (AOO = 12 km\u00b2) and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is smaller than 86 km\u00b2 (it may be as small as 12 km\u00b2). Any confirmed continuing decline will immediately qualify this species for Endangered. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets criterion B). Research is recommended on its distribution, population trend and ecology.", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to Kasos Island (Aegean Islands, Greece), where it is known from at least five localities.", "population": "The species is abundant in the areas where it is found (Riedel 1992, Vardinoyannis 1994).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is known from a cave but also from phryganic areas outside caves (Riedel 1992, Vardinoyannis 1994). The species is considered troglophile as it lives both inside and outside caves.", "threats": "Human disturbance, grazing and fire can potentially restrict the population of the species in the long term.", "conservationmeasures": "The species occurs in at least one protected area (Natura 2000 site). There are no conservation actions regarding the species. Research is recommended on its distribution, population trend and ecology.", "usetrade": "The species is not used or traded."}]}
