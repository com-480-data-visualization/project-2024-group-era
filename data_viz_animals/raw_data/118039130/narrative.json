{"name": "118039130", "result": [{"species_id": 118039130, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 4,098 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 24 km<sup>2</sup>. There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat related to deforestation for the settlement of cattle ranch farms and pollution from mining activities. However, it is not possible to count locations across the entire distribution of the species. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is present in Parguaza River and other small tributaries of the upper Orinoco in Amazonas State: Topocho and two other small streams.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate a population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It inhabits margins of streams with rocky and sandy bottoms, in acidic waters tainted with tannins (Weitzman 1961).", "threats": "Around 66.7% of its area of distribution is represented by shrub savannas, in the lower drainage of the Parguaza River, that are vulnerable due to conversion of for agricultural use for cattle ranch farms and the settlement of villages, as well as by tropical lowland forests in the upper drainage threatened by the extraction of wood and coltan mining (Oliveira-Miranda <em>et al. </em>2010). The species distribution area limits has three coltan mines in the southern border of its limits. All of these suggest that this species is going through habitat loss and degradation.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is not known from any protected areas, but there is a need for habitat protection at sites where it is known to occur.", "usetrade": "This species is collected and traded as an ornamental fish (Lasso 2005), but there are no records about harvest rates, areas of collections, fishing methods, or average lengths of capture. Trade in this species is not regulated by any law."}]}
