There are four locations. Key threats (agriculture and invasive plants) have intensified and remain a threat to this taxon. These are causing is a continuing decline in the EOO, AOO and habitat quality, and it is inferred that the population is in decline too. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Endangered under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Western Cape Province in South Africa, in the Scherpenheuwel area and the eastern side of the Brandvlei Dam near Worcester in the west, as well as near Robertson in the east.", "population": "It is extremely difficult to even estimate the population because of the extended flight period and number of subpopulations.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "This species occurs in open karroid scrub vegetation, preferably open sandy areas at elevations of 200 m to 300 m.", "threats": "This taxon has lost extensive amounts of habitat in the past to crop cultivation and urban development in the Worcester district. Currently it is threatened by alien vegetation and agricultural activity. Future threats could emanate from recreation resorts along the river, and dam and housing developments, which will all pose a major threat to the habitat.", "conservationmeasures": "More research is needed to find additional subpopulations. Monitoring, management and protection of the habitats at the known sites is also required. Research is needed to monitor the population size at the known sites and to locate additional subpopulations; and to establish the life history and ecology including any ant symbionts.", "usetrade": null}]}
