{"name": "61113", "result": [{"species_id": 61113, "taxonomicnotes": "This species previously appeared on the IUCN Red List in the genus <em>Melanochromis</em> Trewavas, 1935 but is now valid in the genus <em>Pseudotropheus </em>Regan, 1922.", "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi, where it occurs only at a small section of Likoma Island. This species has an area of occupancy (AOO) of 4 km<sup>2</sup> and occurs at a single location (Maingano Island to Yofu Bay at the northeastern corner of Likoma Island) based on the threat of overfishing by the ornamental fish trade. This threat is also leading to continuing declines in the number of mature individuals. There is an inferred population decline of 90% over the last 10 years. This species is, therefore, assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi, where it occurs at the northeastern corner of Likoma Island.", "population": "This species is exploited by the ornamental fish trade and its small population is in decline and in danger of extirpation.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "It has been observed over small to medium sized rocks at between 5\u201310 m depth. This species feeds mainly on algae from the aufwuchs on rocks but also on zooplankton and epibenthic invertebrates.&#160;Most male individuals are solitary and show no sign of territoriality. Spawning probably takes place in caves between rocks and mouth-brooding females are rarely seen in the habitat but refrain from feeding while brooding the eggs.", "threats": "Extraction by the ornamental fish trade is a major threat to this species. As an algae-eater it will also suffer increased future sedimentation.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are in place for this species.", "usetrade": "It is very popular among aquarists and is often extracted by the ornamental fish trade. It is best known as \"Electric Blue Johanii\" in the aquarium trade."}]}
