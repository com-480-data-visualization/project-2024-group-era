{"name": "157861694", "result": [{"species_id": 157861694, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents along the Explorer, Juan de Fuca and Gorda Ridges&#160;in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from six restricted locations in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 1,500 m to 2,400 m bsl. The species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted area of occupancy (AOO), and has been found at only six locations, suggesting that it would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. While Location 2 lies within a Marine Protected Area (Glowka 2003), the other locations do not and are still vulnerable to the threat of deep-sea mining. We have therefore opted to assess this species as Near Threatened (NT). Whilst no licences have been granted to date, if mining were to be approved within any of these locations, this species is projected to experience decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. The presence of the species across a large geographical area owing to the spread of hydrothermal vent fields across ocean ridges might give cause for Least Concern (LC), however, this vent species is endemic to vent environments and only occupies a small area of suitable habitat (~ 24 km\u00b2) which is significantly below the Vulnerable (VU) and Endangered (EN) category thresholds for AOO under criterion B. Furthermore, a mining event could possibly impact more than one location, protected or not, due to the close proximity of Locations 2 and 3, as mining sediment plumes are predicted to spread up to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller et al. 2018). Therefore, it would only take a small number of mining events to drive the species to extinction and a reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of the MPA or in the event of mining licences being granted, whereby the assessment could increase to Endangered (EN B2ab(iii)), regardless of the MPA status at Location 2.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to six locations at hydrothermal vents along the Explorer, Juan de Fuca and Gorda Ridges&#160;in the Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al. </em>2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. Locations 1, 2 and 3 fall within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Canada. Despite Locations 2 and 3 being only 62.2 km from each other, they are subject to different regulations within their respective prescribed management areas and are thus considered separate locations. Location 2 encompasses the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area (Glowka 2003), whereas there is currently no such regulation in place at Location 3. Locations 4 and 5 lie outside of national jurisdiction in International Waters, and Location 6 lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the USA. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1,500 m bsl to 2,400 m bsl. It has been observed from six vent fields within these locations: Magic Mountain vent field on the Explorer Ridge (Location 1), the Main Endeavour Field (Location 2), Middle Valley Bent Hill Massive Sulfide (Location 3), South Cleft (Location 4), and Axial Seamount ASHES (Location 5) vent fields on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, and the NESCA vent field on the Gorda Ridge (Location 6) (Waren and Bouchet 1989, Waren and Bouchet 1993, Waren and Bouchet 2001). This species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Waren and Bouchet 1989, Waren and Bouchet 1993, Waren and Bouchet 2001).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 1,500 m to 2,400 m bsl.", "threats": "This species is known to inhabit six locations, four of which fall within the Exclusive Economic Zones of Canada or USA. The remaining two locations are subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact of mining on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner<em> et al.</em> 2018). Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. Whilst no mining licences have been granted for the area to date, these vent fields would be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining were to be permitted by the Canadian and USA governments (Locations 1-4) or the International Seabed Authority (Locations 5-6). Location 2, which includes the Main Endeavour Field, lies within the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area established in 2003 (Glowka 2003). This MPA prohibits the disturbance, damage or removal of any structures or animals without consent from the Minister of Justice for purposes beyond scientific research. We therefore do not consider there to be any threat to Location 2 at this time. However, there is currently no protection for the remaining locations that this species inhabits, leaving open the possibility for the future implementation of mining licences. Furthermore, due to the close proximity between Locations 2 and 3 within Canada's EEZ, if mining were to occur at one site, the sediment plumes from mining activity could negatively affect the other, negating the presence of such an MPA. We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licences to be granted as a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "One of the six locations, which includes Main Endeavour Field, lies within the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area established in 2003 (Glowka 2003). This MPA prohibits the disturbance, damage or removal of any structures or animals without consent from the Minister of Justice for purposes beyond scientific research. However, there are no conservation actions currently in place at the other five locations where this species is found. We recommend that specific national/international legislation is required for the protection of deep-sea habitats and resources. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along nearby ridges.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
