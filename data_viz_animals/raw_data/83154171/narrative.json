The extent of occurrence (EOO) for this species is quite large, however its habitat requirements mean its area of occupancy is quite small (AOO is likely less than 2,000 km\u00b2). It occupies very specific habitats which are considered vulnerable to human pressures.&#160;More studies are necessary in order to assess the type and extent of the impact of human activities on the species, however, currently drainage of humid pastures and disappearance of the coastal marshes are considered possible threats. Therefore, the species is proposed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in New Caledonia (Grande Terre Island) and Vanuatu (Vanua Lava, Espiritu Santo and Tutuba islands).", "population": "There is insufficient information to assess the population size of this species. Davies (2002) claims it is wide spread in the south part of Grande Terre, however, all other studies on the Odonata of New Caledonia (Kimmins 1953, Lieftinck 1975, Marinov <em>et al</em>. 2013, Michalski 2013) and Vanuatu (Kimmins 1936) have established it with single individuals only.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species prefers ponds, grassy marshes, and streams on slopes in forested areas. Most ponds are shallow, and may partially dry out seasonally.", "threats": "Disappearance of coastal marshes and drainage of humid pastures are considered as having a possible negative impact on this species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures in place for this species. Studies aer required on the actual population size, trend and threats.", "usetrade": null}]}
