The populations are believed to be stable because it was resampled after nearly 70 years since its original discovery. However, the species is assessed as Vulnerable because of its small range and a habitat degradation based on the growing habitat alterations for human use (housing areas) and nitrification of aquatic habitats.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Chuuk Islands where it is confined to five small islands (Lieftinck 1962, Buden and Paulson 2004).", "population": "This species is numerous within the small island archipelago. The populations on different islands are assessed as stable because the species was recorded on each of the main islands nearly 70 years after its original description (Buden and Paulson 2004).", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "Buden and Paulson (2004) describe the habitat as&#160;dense, grassy, weedy wet areas with running water, including seepage sites and hill streams. The species was found numerous in ferns, grasses, and shrubs along the banks of the rivers.", "threats": "No threats are recorded for this species, but habitat degradation is assumed due to a growing impact of human activities on the habitats (pollution, agriculture, airborne nitrification).", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures in place for this species.", "usetrade": null}]}
