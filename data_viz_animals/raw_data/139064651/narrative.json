Records from only four of the locations date from after the 1950s. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it might not be large and is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest throughout the range of the species. If more data become available to confirm the AOO as being below 2,000 km\u00b2, the species would qualify for Vulnerable status given the small number of locations. Taking a reasonable precautionary approach it is assessed as Near Threatened. It is to be hoped that re-assessment to Least Concern will be possible once more data are available for this relatively widely distributed species.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Gynacantha musa</em> is known from Java (for instance see Lieftinck 1934, Setiyono <em>et al</em>. 2017), Bali (Kishi 1999), Flores (Lieftinck 1953) and Lombok (Lieftinck 1953).

Lieftinck (1934: 445) recorded a male \u201chovering over a small leaf-bottomed pool in second growth wood\u201d so it appears that the species is not dependent on old growth forest.
