The species has one location based on the most serious plausible threat: water pollution as a result of urban sewage, agricultural run-off and industrial discharges in Lake Patzcuaro. The species is also threatened by overfishing and hybridisation with species of the same genus such as<em>&#160;C. attenuatum</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. grandocule</em>&#160;(Soria-Barreto&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).<em><em> </em></em>As a result of these threats, a population decline in the number of mature individuals has been inferred.<em><em> </em></em>Therefore the species is assessed as Endangered. <br/><em><em></em></em></p><p></p>", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, central Mexico (Miller<em> et al. </em>2005).", "population": "The fishing of charales in the Lake of Patzcuaro has reduced from 523 tn / year in 1985 to 157 tn / year in 1997 (Orbe-Mendoza and Acevedo 2002). <em>Chirostoma</em>&#160;species are particularly susceptible to environmental change and this species is also heavily fished for human consumption. Some evidence exists that average size has decreased and population has declined.
