The other collection localities where this species has been documented remain free from major anthropogenic impacts. Given uncertainties regarding the scope and direct impact of regionally pervasive threats at it is not possible to accurately estimate the number of threat-based locations where this species occurs. Therefore, <em>M. negomata</em> is assessed as Near Threatened under criterion B1ab(iii).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Microlepidogaster negomata </em>is known from Bebedouro Creek and the Curral das \u00c9guas River in the Abaet\u00e9 River drainage, a left bank tributary of the S\u00e3o Francisco River basin in Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil (Martins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The type locality of this species is a very small stream near Arapu\u00e1 municipality at an elevation of 912-1032 m above sea level (Martins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p>  <p>Extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 5,606 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (Martins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The number of threat-based location where this species occurs cannot be accurately estimated due to uncertainties regarding the scope and direct impact of diffuse threats (e.g., surface water abstraction, cattle ranching, agricultural expansion) throughout the region.</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown.</p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>The type locality of this species is a small stream characterized by a width of 0.8 m, a maximum depth of 0.4 m, and substrates of gravel, stones, and sand (Martins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Riparian vegetation is primarily composed of herbs and grasses, and is surrounded by a grazing area with a few palm trees and shrubs (Martins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Bank erosion and high sunlight exposure are evident at the type locality (Martins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).

Bebedouro Creek is impacted primarily by cattle ranching, which has increased streambank erosion and subsequent sedimentation processes at the type locality (Brito&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Martins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Curral das \u00c9guas is characterized by relatively pristine water conditions, and some evidence shows intact aquatic invertebrate assemblages suggesting a low degree of habitat degradation (Neto and Ferreira 2013). The Abaet\u00e9 River mainstem is relatively free from major impacts and serves as an important tributary stream for reproductive migrations downstream of the Tr\u00eas Marias Dam (Sato&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Paschoalini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).</p>  <p>Despite uncertainties regarding the direct impact and scope of existing threats, continuing decline in habitat quality in at least one threat-based location is inferred.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>M. negomata</em>.
