{"name": "163851", "result": [{"species_id": 163851, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The species is assessed as Endangered because it is known from a small number of locations with a small extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). It is likely that there will be a continuing decline in at least the extent and quality of the habitat.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Guadalcanal (Solomon Islands) where it is known from seven localities. All known records were collected between 1953 and 2005.", "population": "Information is lacking regarding population numbers, although it is thought to be decreasing.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span>From the habitat descriptions given when the specimens were taken, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lieftinckia lairdi</span> is known to occur at running water. These habitats include a river; a slow flowing pool formed by seepage alongside river, by ford; on a ridge above Sutakiki river and hill country of northwest Guadalcanal Island, upper reaches of Tenaru River, backwater of a stream near Betilonga Village (freshly emerged Zygopteron clining to half-submerged log). It is not unlikely that the species is confined to forest.", "threats": "It is not known whether this species is confined to forest habitats; if it is then deforestation is the main threat. It is unknown what impact the mining on Bougainville has on the quality of the freshwater systems and on the species that inhabit them.", "conservationmeasures": "There does not appear to be any conservation measures in place and fieldwork is needed to fully understand the habitat status and population numbers as it is likely the habitat is in decline.", "usetrade": null}]}
