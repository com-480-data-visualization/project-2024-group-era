The main threats to the species are water pollution  caused by  recreational activities at the Ramsar Site and agricultural  run-off from  the surrounding area. The presence of Coip\u00fa (<em>Myocastor coypus</em>)  has also lead to a decline in the species' habitat  quality. Considering its limited distribution (AOO 4 km<sup>2</sup>), presence in only one location, and threats,&#160;<em>Fundulus philpisteri </em>is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR).", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to Ba\u00f1o de San Ignacio spring and marshes, within Rio San Fernando basin in Nuevo Leon State, Mexico (Garcia-Ramirez <em>et al.</em> 2006, A.
