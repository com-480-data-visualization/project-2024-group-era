Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 210 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a limited number of available georeferenced collection records. Total population size and population trend are unknown. However, the majority of this species known range has been converted into intensively managed coffee plantations, which have resulted in considerable deforestation, increased sedimentation, and loss of habitat. Given the extensive scope of land-use changes, this species is inferred to occur in two to four threat-based locations. Despite uncertainties regarding the magnitude and direct impacts of habitat conversion, it is inferred to have resulted in a decline in the quality of aquatic habitat available. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii). Additional research on distribution, population status, and the impact of threats is a conservation priority.", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cynodonichthys uroflammmeus</em> is distributed on the Pacific versant of Central America in the T\u00e9rraba and Coto river drainages in Costa Rica, and possibly extending southward to the Chiriqu\u00ed River drainage, Panama (Bussing 1998, Smith and Bermingham 2005, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Elevational distribution ranges from 750-1100 meters above sea level (Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013). The type locality of this species is a pond in the town of San Vito, Puntacarenas, Costa Rica (Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p>  Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 210 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around a very limited number of georeferenced collection records (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019, GBIF 2019).

Georeferenced collection records occur primarily around the towns of Cahnguena, Limoncito, San Vito, and Agua Buena.

Additionally, reductions in tree cover have likely reduced dry-season flow rates (Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p>  <p>There is considerable uncertainty regarding the scope and magnitude of impacts to this species resulting from extensive land-use change to coffee production.
