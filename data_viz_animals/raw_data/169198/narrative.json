Known from 4 locations, where records were done after 1990; The record from Bioko (Equatorial Guinea) needs confirmation. The extent of occurrence (EOO) of the post-1990 records is 2,453 km\u00b2 and the area of occupancy (AOO) is 28 km\u00b2. All records are outside protected areas and new surveys are urgently necessary. The forest habitat that the species occurs in is expected to deteriorate in the future in Cameroon and is currently declining in Bioko due to deforestation and is therefore listed as Endangered B1ab(ii,iii) + 2ab(ii,iii).", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from west Cameroon (where it is known from Mamfe-Takamanda area only, south western Province) and an old record from Bioko (Equatorial Guinea).", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species habitat is rainforest streams.", "threats": "The specific threats to the species in the highlands of Cameroon are unknown but forest destruction is believed to be potential threat. There is very widespread selective logging currently taking place on Bioko (Amakye pers. comm.).", "conservationmeasures": "None in place. Further research into the species habitat, ecology, population, range and threats is required, as well as habitat conservation measures.", "usetrade": null}]}
