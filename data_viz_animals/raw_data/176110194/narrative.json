The species occur in upper tributaries of Ariari and Guayabero rivers, near to Serran\u00eda de la Macarena. There are records from the upper section (headwaters) of tributaries of the In\u00edrida River, adjacent to Serran\u00eda de la Macarena (Ballen<em> et al.</em> 2016). The records include the creeks (ca\u00f1os) Irique, Up\u00edn, Iraca, Indio and Guayapa.

The waters have a pH of 5.60, conductivity of 0.00061 Sm/l, and dissolved oxygen of 5.9 mg/l (Ballen <em>et al. </em>2016). <em>Farlowella mitoupibo</em> can reach 209.5 mm standard length. <em>Farlowella species </em>are herbivores that eat algae (e.g. Bacillariophyceae) and have moderate fecundity (Garc\u00eda-Alzate&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).", "threats": "In the upper tributaries of Guaviare and Meta drainages, the habitat for <em>Farlowella mitoupibo</em> is affected by increasing deforestation and agricultural practices, which affect the riverbanks. Similarly, local sedimentation, associated with deforestation and urban waste, has deleterious effects on the aquatic environment.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no known conservation plans for <em>Farlowella mitoupibo</em>. The species occurs in National Natural Park Sierra de la Macarena (DoNascimiento <em>et al</em>. 2018, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020). Habitat protection of the most impacted drainages and awareness at several educative levels are recommended. It is is necessary to research trends for the population, threats and habitat.", "usetrade": "Due to its recent description, no information is available on the use and trade of the species <em>Farlowella mitoupibo</em>, but it is probably included within the <em>Farlowella </em>species that are exploited in the Orinoco ornamental fisheries in Colombia."}]}
