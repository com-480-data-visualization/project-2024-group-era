The assessors are aware of records from 16 localities, however most of these date from 1949 or earlier; there are only recent records from five localities (interpreted as locations based on plausible threats and the distribution of these records). The species is present in two protected areas: Manupeu Tanah Daru and Laiwangi Wanggameti National Parks. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining to some degree at least, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, due to loss of habitat outside protected areas in Sumba. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is &lt;20,000 km\u00b2. Given that the species is currently confirmed to still occur only five locations, it is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it seems likely that this species is still widespread across Sumba, and it is therefore hoped that a reassessment to Near Threatened or even Least Concern will be possible in the not-too-distant future when more information is available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Rhinocypha sumbana</em> is endemic to Sumba in the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia, where it is known from records scattered across most of the island (Irawan and Rahadi 2018; Lieftinck 1936, 1953).
