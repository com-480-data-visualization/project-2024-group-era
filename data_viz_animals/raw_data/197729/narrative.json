However, this species is now considered Possibly Extinct in Lake Matano after surveys in 2017 and 2018 failed to recover the species&#160;(T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). Von Rintelen and Cai (2009) note that the species may be more widespread in Lake Towuti, based on older records that require confirmation.", "population": "In Lake Matano no specimens of this species were found in 2017 or 2018 at two sites where it was present in 2013 (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018), and it is now considered to be possibly extinct in this lake. This decline was likely due to the impact of invasive Flowerhorn Chiclids (<em>Colossoma</em>&#160;sp.) as&#160;<em>Caridina</em><em> </em>species are an important part of their diet (Herder <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;Based on this and the spread of Flowerhorn Cichlids in the Malili lakes, an overall population decline of &gt;90% is predicted over the next 10 years (T. von Rintelen pers. comm. 2018). They have now been confirmed in the downstream Lake Mahalona (W. Darwall pers. obs. 2018) and are assumed, therefore, to also occur in River Petea, which connects Lake Matano and Mahalona. If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona, and are predicted to cause population declines similar to those seen in Lake Matano populations.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Caridina loehae</span> is a hard substrate species, mainly&#160;occurring&#160;on rocks and gravel shallower than five metres depth.", "threats": "<p>  </p><p>Current threats to the species are nickel mining and hydro-electric power installations on the outlet of Danau Matano, which impact the outflow and natural water level fluctuations throughout the entire lake system. Siltation due to erosion and organic effluents from the rapidly expanding human population around the lakes are also problematic. The species is collected for the aquarium trade. Most critically, invasive species (particularly Flowerhorn Cichlids, <em>Colossoma</em> sp.) have been introduced to Lake Matano and <em>Caridina</em> species are an important part of their diet (Herder <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;In addition to their direct impact in Lake Matano, where this species is thought to be extinct, Flowerhorn Cichlids have now been confirmed in Lake Mahalona (W.

If not already present in Lake Towuti, the Flowerhorn Cichlids will soon spread downstream to the lake, as River Tominanga connecting these two lakes is much less of a barrier than the river between Lakes Matano and Mahalona.

While some algal cover was observed before, this seems to have spread dramatically also to sites where none was observed before on rocks and roots in particular (T. von Rintelen pers. obs. 2018). Whether this apparent eutrophication is linked to the eradication of native shrimps by Flowerhorn Cichlids or to water level regulation by the mining company PT Vale remains to be investigated.&#160;</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">No conservation plans are currently in place for this species, but protection and management of its known localities is needed along with research into its population dynamics, ecology and threats.
