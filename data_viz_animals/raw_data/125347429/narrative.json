Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 1127 km<sup>2</sup>, and this species is inferred to occur in 3 locations. Existing threats include deforestation and land-use change associated with agricultural expansion, and associated increases in sedimentation. Additionally, non-native competitors and parasites have been introduced into habitat occupied by <em>T. portillorum</em>. While there are considerable uncertainties regarding the direct impact, scope, and magnitude of existing threats, they have resulted in an inferred continuous decline in habitat quality. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "<p></p><p><em>Tlaloc portillorum</em> is one of four species of freshwater fishes endemic to Honduras (McCranie <em>et al</em>. 2018), where it has been collected in the headwaters of the Ul\u00faa and Nacaome River basins on the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Honduras, respectively (Matamoros and Schaefer 2010, Matamoros <em>et al</em>. 2012, Salgado-Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2014, Morcillo <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species has the southernmost range extent of any known species in its family (Matamoros <em>et al</em>. 2012). Elevational distribution ranges from 1340-1656 meters above sea level (Matamoros and Schaefer 2010, Salgado-Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>  <p>Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 1,127 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around all available georeferenced collection records (Salgado-Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2014, GBIF 2019, W.

However, much of the land is still forested and managed sustainably (Nygren 2005). The invasive Asian fish tapeworm <em>Bothriocephalus acheilognathi</em> is a confirmed parasite of <em>T. portillorum</em> in the Nacaome River, where it may impact individual fitness in parasitized individuals (Caspeta-Mandujano <em>et al</em>. 2015). Spread of this introduced parasite to adjacent drainages may present additional threats. The non-native <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em> has also been introduced in drainages where this species occurs, and may have negative impacts on habitat quality and availability (Matamoros and Schaefer 2010).</p>  While the direct impact, scope, and magnitude of these threats have not been evaluated in detail, their cumulative effects have resulted in an inferred, continuous decline in the quality of available habitat.", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>T. portillorum</em>, and it has not been recorded within the boundaries of any protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2019).
