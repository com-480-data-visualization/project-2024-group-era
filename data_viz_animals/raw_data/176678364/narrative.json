The extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 1,888 km<sup>2</sup>. Total population size and population trend are unknown. The primary threats to freshwater habitat in the Piura River drainage include runoff and other pollutants, deforestation, hydrological modification and unsustainable agricultural practices. Despite uncertainties regarding the direct impact of existing threats, continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred. However, it is not possible to calculate locations based on the uncertainty over the direct impact of threats. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened, meeting criteria B1b(iii).<br/></p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Trichomycterus piurae</em> is known only from the Piura river drainage on the Pacific slope of northern Peru (de Pinna and Wosiacki 2003).

Specific instances of these stressors are apparent in the Piura River drainage (Urteaga-Crovetto 2016). Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) has established in a number of Andean drainages throughout Peru as a result of multiple introduction events to support recreational fishing, aquaculture, and food fisheries, and may be causing declines in population size through direct predation (Coss\u00edos 2010, Arismendi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).</p>  <p>Despite uncertainties regarding the scope and direct impact of existing threats to <em>T. piurae</em>, continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>T. piurae</em>.
