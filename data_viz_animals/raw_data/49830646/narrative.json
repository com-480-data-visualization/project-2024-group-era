{"name": "49830646", "result": [{"species_id": 49830646, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is assessed as Vulnerable. It has an area of occupancy (AOO) best estimated at 1,376 km<sup>2</sup>. Its distribution is affected by extensive deforestation of headwaters and riparian forest, extraction of  water&#160;directly from rivers, urban and agro-industrial untreated  effluents and transformation of channels by dams and canalization. There are two locations based on these threats and an inferred continuing decline in habitat quality.", "geographicrange": "<em>Creagrutus atratus</em> is endemic to Colombia and known from the Andean piedmont. Its type locality is R\u00edo&#160;Caqueza, a tributary to R\u00edo Negro, about 2 km upstream of village of Caqueza, Meta drainage, Cundinamarca (Vari and Harold&#160;2001). The species inhabis upper sections of rivers Up\u00eda, Meta and Arauca (Maldonado-Ocampo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Urbano-Bonilla&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>The distribution of&#160;<em>Creagrutus atratus</em>&#160;in this assessment is a summary based on scientific reports and records compiled, arranged and reviewed from the following sources: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2020), FishNet2 (Fishnet2 2020), FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2019), SiB Colombia (SiB Colombia 2020) and SpeciesLink (SpeciesLink 2020), and complemented with records from the databases of the following ichthyological collections from Colombia: CZUT-IC (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica, Universidad del Tolima, Ibagu\u00e9), IAvH-P (Colecci\u00f3n de Peces de Agua Dulce del Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n de Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos Alexander von Humboldt, Villa de Leyva), ICN-MHN (Instituto de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1), IMCN (Colecci\u00f3n Zool\u00f3gica de Referencia Cient\u00edfica del Museo de Ciencias Naturales Federico Carlos Lehmann Valencia del INCIVA, Cali), and MPUJ (Museo Javeriano de Historia Natural \"Lorenzo Uribe, S.J.\" de la Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot\u00e1), and Venezuela: MCNG (Museo de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Nacional Experimental de los Llanos Occidentales Ezequiel Zamora, Guanare, Venezuela) and CPUCLA (Colecci\u00f3n Regional de Peces, Museo de Ciencias Naturales de la Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado, Barquisimeto, Venezuela).", "population": "According to the natural abundance and broad distribution of <em>Creagrutus atratus</em>, the total population size is suspected to be greater than 10,000 individuals.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "<p>The habitat for <em>Creagrutus atratus</em>&#160;includes creeks, streams and rivers principally in piedmonts and mountains. It inhabits slow currents, clear waters and varied substrates (mud, sand, gravel). The fishes of the genus <em>Creagrutus</em> are omnivorous and feed on aquatic and terrestrial insects, plants and seeds. They can reach 70 mm in standard length. The reproduction is probably periodic and in the rainy season.</p>", "threats": "<p>Some drainages and rivers where&#160;<em>Creagrutus atratus</em> occurs remain in good condition. However, in many others drainages impacts include extensive deforestation of headwaters and riparian forest, extraction of water&#160;directly from rivers, urban and agro-industrial untreated effluents and transformation of channels by dams and canalization.&#160;These threats have not ceased and are expected to expand in the future.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "It is not known from any conservation sites or protected areas&#160;(IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020) but is possibly in Natural Park Chingaza. There are no laws, regulations and educational programs for its protection. Awareness raising and communications are recommended. It is necessary to research the population size and distribution, threats and habitat.<p></p>", "usetrade": "<p>There are no known uses for the species.<br/></p>"}]}
