Existing threats include land-use changes, agricultural expansion, and agricultural pollution.

Reductions in tree cover have likely reduced dry-season flow rates (Krishnaswamy <em>et al</em>. 2018). Agricultural activities (primarily african palm plantation agriculture) continues to result in the runoff of nutrients, sediments, and herbicides and pesticides (Rojas and Rodr\u00edguez 2008).

This species likely occurs in more than one protected area (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020), but existing threats are expected to be pervasive within park boundaries, given the connectivity of upstream habitat.
