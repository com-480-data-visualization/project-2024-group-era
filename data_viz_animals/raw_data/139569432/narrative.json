Satellite images show significant loss of and degradation to forest in the area where this species was found and the main threat to it will be from clearance of forest for agriculture. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but since only a single location is definitely known, the currently known AOO is less than 10 km\u00b2. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in the area where it occurs. The species qualifies for Critically Endangered status under criterion B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta trimaculata</em> is known only from the holotype male, collected in 1876 at Bilucao in southern central Luzon in the Philippines (Lieftinck 1939). Additionally there are specimens listed as <em>Drepanosticta</em> sp. cf. <em>philippa</em>/<em>trimaculata</em> from Marinduque (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Muller 1997) and Polillo (Villanueva 2010a,b) whose status has not been resolved from another six locations; these are excluded from further consideration in this assessment because of the uncertainty involved. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but since only a single location is definitely known the known AOO is likely to be less than 10 km\u00b2.

Resolution of taxonomic issues is also urgently required. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
