{"name": "176044483", "result": [{"species_id": 176044483, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p>This species is classified as Endangered. It is restricted to the  Upper Caron\u00ed River Basin in the Kuken\u00e1n River, with an area of occupancy  (AOO) of 12-500 km<sup>2</sup> and an extent of the occurrence (EOO) of 840 km<sup>2</sup>.  There is a single threat-based location related to the impacts of  illegal mining. These impacts are also causing a continuing decline in  the extent and quality of its habitat.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p>This species is known from the Orinoco Basin (Venezuela), restricted  to the upper Caron\u00ed River, Gran Sabana region (Kuken\u00e1n River), base of  the Kuken\u00e1n and Roraima tepuis, Bol\u00edvar State. It is sympatric with <em>T. celsae</em>&#160;(Lasso and Provenzano 2003).</p>", "population": "<p>It appears to be abundant in its natural environment.<strong></strong></p>", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "<p>It occurs in rivers of black and clear waters of Venezuelan Guiana  (upper Caron\u00ed, Gran Sabana region), with rocky bottoms, very fast  waters, and strong current (Lasso and Provenzano 2003, Lasso <em>et al.</em> 2009).<strong></strong></p>", "threats": "<p>The primary threat is mining, which occurs in the upper Caron\u00ed basin  within the Orinoco for bauxite, copper, coltan, diamonds, iron and gold.  This results in deforestation, riverbed alteration, sedimentation,  contamination by heavy metals, and spills of gasoline, oil and human  sewage (CERLAS 2019, Hitcher 2020, SOS-Orinoco 2020).</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>There are no conservation plans for this species. Its range includes  Canaima National Park, but this is currently heavily affected by illegal  mining and deforestation. Research is needed to better determine its  distribution, size and population trend, and other threats.</p>", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
