An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy of this species is not possible with the available information but, based on its specialised habitats, it is very likely to be below 500 km\u00b2, possibly considerably less than this, and is inferred to be declining because of loss of forest throughout Mindanao. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are also inferred to be declining, as is the overall population, which is clearly severely fragmented.
