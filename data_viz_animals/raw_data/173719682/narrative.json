Two of the known locations are in Kon Ka Kinh National Park in the same part of Viet Nam. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of and disturbance to forest within the range of the species. Its current known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 666\u20131,916 km\u00b2. The species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iiii)).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Coeliccia hayashii </em>is apparently endemic to Viet Nam. It was described from males from a location in central Viet Nam (Phan and Kompier 2016) and later recorded from two locations in Kon Ka Kinh National Park in the same part of Vietnam (Phan and Ngo 2019). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of and disturbance to forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 666 km\u00b2 (based on a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around the known data points); its maximum EOO is 1,916 km\u00b2 (based on an MCP around the HydroBASINS known to be occupied by this species).</p>", "population": "<p>The species is not common at the type locality but is quite common at the other known locations. Beyond this all that can be said is that an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss and disturbance of forest in the part of Viet Nam where it occurs.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Writing about the type locality for this specis, Phan and Kompier (2016: 408) state \u201capparently very specific choice of habitat. Males held territories sheltered by an overhanging rock surface where water seeped through and over the rock over clay surface with sparse vegetation, sheltered from direct sunlight.\u201d However, the habitat where the species was recorded at the one of the other locations is described as a \u201cmarsh near a hydro electric dam\u201d (Phan and Ngo 2017: 2), here marsh appears to mean a swampy area or seepage under canopy cover. It appears that the exact habitat requirements of the species are not well understood, but it is almost certain that it is forest-dependent. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are inferred to be declining due to loss and degradation of forest within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main general threat to this species will be from deforestation with farming as the main driver. The type locality and its surrounds have been seriously impacted by tourist activities and uncontrolled logging by local communities. </p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for more information on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
