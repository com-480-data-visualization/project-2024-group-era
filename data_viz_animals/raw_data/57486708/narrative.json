{"name": "57486708", "result": [{"species_id": 57486708, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Melanochromis wochepa</em>&#160;is endemic to Lake Malawi. It is found along the Mozambique shore of the lake between Nkhungu Point and the Chiloelo River. It meets the area requirements under criterion B2 for Endangered and occurs at one location. Sedimentation and aquarium trade might threaten the population and cause continuing declines in the population size and habitat quality, but this is uncertain. This species is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi and is only found between Nkhungu Point and the Chiloelo River in Mozambique (Konings-Dudin&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Konings and Stauffer 2012).", "population": "Konings-Dudin <em>et al.</em> (2009) mention that this species is not uncommon. Other than that, there is no information available on the population size and population trend of this species.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "This species occurs in shallow, rocky habitats and is mostly seen solitary (Konings-Dudin <em>et al</em>. 2009). Males in breeding colouration do not defend a territory, but displays between males are frequent and of short duration (Konings-Dudin <em>et al. </em>2009). It primarily feeds from the aufwuchs on rocks, from which it picks algal strands and diatoms (Konings-Dudin <em>et al. </em>2009).", "threats": "Sedimentation near river mouths and collection for the aquarium trade might impact this species.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are known for this species.", "usetrade": "It is rarely collected by the ornamental fish trade where it is known as \"Blue Dwarf Auratus\". This small mbuna is of no importance to subsistence fishermen."}]}
