Laubuca</em> was believed to be a misspelling of the genus name (Kottelat 2013).", "rationale": "<em>Laubuka varuna</em> is an endemic, range-restricted species, known from four locations in the western lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka. Its estimated Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is around 2078 km<sup>2</sup> and its Area of Occupancy (AOO) is about 92 km<sup>2</sup>. Its habitat is declining due to logging and rapid expansion of agriculture. Habitat quality has being degraded due to accumulation of agrochemicals and siltation. These threats are likely to continue as its area is undergoing agricultural expansion and development and there is no current protection for a majority of its habitat. Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Sri Lanka and restricted to streams in the Attanagalu, Kelani and Kalu river basins within the lowland dry zone (De Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).", "population": "There is no available population data for this uncommon species. However, it is possible to infer a decline in its population on the basis of the threats it faces.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<em>L. varuna </em>is found to occupy habitats restricted to shady forest streams with sandy or leafy litter substrate (De Silva <em>et al</em>. 2005).", "threats": "The species is threatened by deforestation water pollution due to agrochemicals and siltation.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation plans in place for this species.", "usetrade": "No known uses have been recorded for this species."}]}
