{"name": "176155201", "result": [{"species_id": 176155201, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species occurs in remote, relatively pristine areas of the Approuague River basin. Its population is thought to be under threat due to gold mining, and the habitat is inferred to be in continuing decline. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 8,578 km<sup>2</sup> and there are six locations based on the threat of mining. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "This species is known only from the middle and upper portions of the Approuague River basin in eastern French Guiana. The type locality is Clique Japigny, Arataye, tributary of Fleuve Approuague, upriver of Pierette, French Guiana.", "population": "There are no data available on the population size for this species, but it occurs along a considerable length of the Approuague River in several different tributary creeks, and so its total population is assumed to be greater than 10,000 individuals.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "Creeks draining the Guiana Shield are typically shaded with a substrate of sand and abundant leaf pack and debris from the overhead forest. Water is typically clear to tea-coloured, with acid pH, low conductivity, low dissolved nutrients and high transparency.&#160;Most <em>Creagrutus </em>feed on aquatic invertebrates, and all are oviparous.", "threats": "Although there are no data about specific threats to this species, it occurs in areas where gold mining is known to occur.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no specific conservation measures protecting this species. It is classified as Near Threatened in French Guiana because of its small geographic distribution (IUCN France <em>et al.</em> 2017).", "usetrade": "This species is not used."}]}
