All the current known locations are within National Parks (Pu Mat and Vu Quang) and are not far from the border with Laos, so the species should also be looked for in that country. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, its AOO and extent and quality of suitable habitat (at least outside protected areas) are all inferred to be declining to some degree due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its known extent of occurrence (EOO) is 153\u20134,799 km\u00b2. Although all current known locations are within protected areas, this species, with its small known EOO, appears inherently vulnerable to threatening events. Taking the reasonable precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, the species is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (EN B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it is hoped that when more data are available, a reassessment to a lower threat category will be possible.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Coeliccia natgeo</em> is known from four localities in central Viet Nam (Phan <em>et al. </em>2020), all the known localities are within National Parks (Pu Mat and Vu Quang) and are not far from the border with Laos, so the species should also be looked for in that country.
