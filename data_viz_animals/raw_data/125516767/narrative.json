The assessors are aware of records from 23 localities, however most of these date from 1949 or earlier; there are only recent records from five locations on Sumba. The species is present in two protected areas on Sumba: Manupeu Tanah Daru and Laiwangi Wanggameti National Parks. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining to some degree at least, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat, due to loss of habitat outside protected areas. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is larger than the criterion B1 threshold for Vulnerable. Since the species is confirmed to still occur in only five locations and there is continuing decline in habitat and AOO, it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU B1ab(ii,iii)). However, it seems likely that this species is still widespread on Sumba, at least, and it is therefore hoped that a reassessment to Least Concern will be possible in the not-too-distant future when more information is available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<em>Nososticta selysi</em> is known from Sumba in the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia, where it is known from records scattered across most of the island, and also from the west of Flores, Komodo and Sawu (Irawan and Rahadi 2018, Lieftinck 1930, 1953, Seehausen and Theischinger 2017).
