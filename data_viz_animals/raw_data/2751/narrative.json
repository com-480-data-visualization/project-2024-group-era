{"name": "2751", "result": [{"species_id": 2751, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 30 km<sup>2</sup> and has only one threat-based location, which is threatened by overfishing, pollution and sedimentation. Severe habitat changes have been observed and are projected for the near future (Van Boxclaer<em> et al. </em>2012) and this species is thought to have disappeared from the lower depths of Lake Malawi, although the reason for the decline at lower depths is unclear. It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi and has been found down to 87 m (Brown 1994), but only around the Nankumba Peninsula.", "population": "This species is thought to be possibly extinct at depths between 20- 80 m, although the cause of this decline is unknown. The threats of&#160;pollution and over fishing are projected to cause a decline in the future.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi and is historically found down to 87 m (Brown 1994), but recent surveys found it down to 20 m only.", "threats": "This species is threatened by overfishing, pollution and sedimentation from domestic and agricultural sources. Monkey Bay, where this species occurs, is one of the most impacted areas around Lake Malawi from increasing human activity (Van Boxclaer<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012).", "conservationmeasures": "There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, although the remaining population of this species is close to the Lake Malawi National Park. Dedicated deep water surveys would help to understand the decline of this and other deep-water confined species.", "usetrade": "There is no information on the use and trade of this species."}]}
