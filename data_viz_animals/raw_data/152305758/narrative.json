{"name": "152305758", "result": [{"species_id": 152305758, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to the Pacific slope of eastern Panama, where it occurs in the Balsis, Tu\u00edra, Chucunaque, and Bayano River drainages. Extent of Occurrence is estimated to be 7,924 km<sup>2</sup>. Population size and population trend are unknown, and the species is only known from a limited number of collections. Potential threats include deforestation, agricultural expansion, mining activities, and road infrastructure development within the Darien region. While the scope and magnitude of these threats are unknown, they are having inferred negative impacts on habitat quality. Given a number of locations that is not suspected to exceed 10, a relatively restricted range, and a number of continuing threats that have produced inferred continuous declines in habitat quality, this species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B1ab(iii).", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Darienheros calobrensis</em> is endemic to the Pacific slope of eastern Panama, where it has been reported from the Balsas, Tu\u00edra, Chucunaque, and Bayano River drainages (Kullander 2003, Smith and Bermingham 2005, Garc\u00e9s and Garc\u00eda 2007).&#160;</p>  Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 7,924 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around available georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2019). While there is significant uncertainty regarding the magnitude and scope of potential threats, the most pervasive threat of land conversion associated with agricultural development is likely to produce negative impacts in all downstream catchments. As such, the number of locations where this species occurs is expected to be fewer than 10.", "population": "<p>The total population size of this species is unknown. It is poorly represented in museum collections (GBIF 2019).
