{"name": "167775", "result": [{"species_id": 167775, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 9,120 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 60 km<sup>2</sup>. There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat related to deforestation and pollution from illegal mining activities. However, it is not possible to count locations across the entire range. Therefore, it is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is only known from the Guiana Shield. It has been collected only in the upper Caura Basin, in the Erebato, Kakada, Tawadu and Suajadito rivers, and in the main channel of the Caura.", "population": "There are no data available to estimate the population size.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This is a benthopelagic (ecological region at the lowest level of water body) species that is often found in large rivers in swift current, and in rapids among dense stands of the rooted vegetation.  It also inhabits small streams, rapids, bays and backwaters over sand, gravel and rocky bottoms.&#160;It inhabits the margins of streams with rocky and sandy bottoms in acidic waters tainted with tannins (Chernoff <em>et al. </em>2002).", "threats": "The main threat for this species comes from habitat loss and degradation due to the presence of gold mines. One illegal gold mine (Las Pavas) occurs within the species distribution area and other one is approximately 34 km from the southernmost locality in the Kakada River (Sanchez 2015).", "conservationmeasures": "The entire population occurs within the newly created national park that encompasses the entire basin of the Caura River. Nevertheless, the area is being rapidly degraded because of the presence of gold mines.", "usetrade": "It is unknown if this species is traded in the ornamental fish market, or if it is part of the livelihoods of indigenous peoples."}]}
