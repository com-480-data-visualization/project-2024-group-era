According to analysis of distributional data, its extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) both are estimated at 4 km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/> This species\u2019 only known locality has three types of continuing decline in habitat quality: (1) reduced dwellable habitats resulting from cave tourism, (2) reduced prey abundance resulting from a decline in the number of bat droppings, and (3) reduced prey abundance resulting from the screening effects of artificial structures at the cave entrance.<br/><br/> This species' locality could be divided into five locations based on the types and intensity of threats: (1) those that are directly accessible to tourists; (2) those that are not open, but are indirectly disturbed because of their vicinity to the open area; (3) those that are not open, but have a reduced bat population; (4) those that are not open, but are affected by the entrance structure's screening effects; and (5) those that remain.<br/><br/>Based on the above, this species falls into criteria B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "<em>Falcileptoneta hwanseonensis</em> is a cave spider endemic to the Republic of Korea (National Institute of Biological Resources 2014). This species is currently known to be endemic to the Hwanseon Cave, Samcheok-si, Gangwon-do Province, Republic of Korea (N 37\u00b019\u203210.80\u2032\u2032, E 129\u00b000\u203227.52\u2032\u2032, 535m asl; Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a). In its entirety, the total span of the winding tunnels in this limestone cave is about 8.5 km (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a). It is possible for this species to be distributed in nearby subterranean terrains away from researchers' reach even though it has only been observed in one cave in several cave surveys in the region. Even so, the distribution of this species must be highly localized.<br/><br/> The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup> based on a 2x2 km grid overlay on the range map. Following IUCN Guidelines, the extent of occurrence (EOO) is increased to match the AOO; therefore, the final EOO used in this assessment is 4 km<sup>2</sup>.", "population": "This species has been steadly recorded from 1965 to 2009 (Namkung 1993; Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a,b; Kim 2015). According to Namkung (1993) and Kim (2015), only small numbers of individuals could be observed in the known locality. So far, this species has been recorded in two sections of the cave, one is open to the public while the other is closed. Cave tourism has contributed to a reduction on the number of individuals from some of their occurrence spots (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a,b), although it is unknown what the trend in total population size is currently.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "In the cave environment, this species has been found in irregular sheet webs under stones or silt layers at the bottom of the cave (National Institute of Biological Resources 2014). There is a debate about whether this species is a troglophile (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a,b) or a troglobite (Namkung 1993, Kim 2015). However, this species, regardless of whether it is troglobitic or not, must have highly fidelity to the cave because most Korea members of the family Leptonetidae can only be found in the type locality or a very small number of localities in a region (Seo 2015, Lan <em>et al</em>. 2021). Therefore, this species would be very vulnerable to habitat disturbance.", "threats": "This species' only known locality (Hwanseon Cave) has been open to the public since 1997, with 942,164 tourists visiting each year, on average. There are three cave-tourism-related factors suspected to be responsible for the continuing decline in habitat quality.<br/><br/> (1) Environmental changes, including light pollution: It has been observed that this species' frequency of appearance and occupation points have decreased in the section accessible to tourists after the tourism opening. It is inferred that as a result of tourism opening, the population of this species has decreased, or at least its distribution has become more limited (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a,b). There are still a few individuals subsisting in a tiny no-light zone in a section opened to tourists (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a,b). Therefore, tourism seems to still have a direct and continuous impact on species. Furthermore, the observational results indicate that the population size in adjacent closed areas to public areas has also declined since tourism began, despite maintaining similar environmental conditions (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010b).<br/><br/> (2) Bat population reduction: Since this cave was opened to the public, the bat population has rapidly shrunk (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2010a). There was a large bat population in this species' habitation before the cave opening. As one of the major trophic sources in cave communities, an abundance of bat guano can regulate the biodiversity and distribution of cave spiders (Ferreira and Martins 1998). Consequently, the reduction in guano can downsize cave arthropod abundance (Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2007). This species, as a predator, can also experience a continuous decline in habitat quality as a result of declining prey abundance.<br/><br/> (3) Entrance construction: The access of troglophiles and external organic litters has been restricted as a result of the construction of artificial structures at the cave's entrance. According to Cave Research Institute of Korea (2010a,b), the construction of the entrance makes it difficult to find previously recorded troglophiles from the habitats of this species. Considering that they are supporting predators in the cave environment, a decrease in the incoming energy source has negatively impacted predatory spiders' subsistence.", "conservationmeasures": "Steps need to be taken to reduce the impact of tourism on Hwanseon Cave, where pollution has been a significant problem. Despite efforts to clean the cave and replace lamps, the contamination quickly returned due to inadequate management (Cultural Heritage Administration 2012, Cave Research Institute of Korea 2016, Y.-K. Kim pers. comm.). The Cultural Heritage Administration (2012) proposed several measures to preserve the cave ecosystem, including relocating and reducing the intensity of lights, changing the direction of illumination, monitoring light pollution, limiting visitors with guided tours, and focusing on intended points of illumination to prevent light scattering. <br/><br/>Additionally, a recent report of a new locality of this species discovered in a cave in Gyeongsangbuk-do Province (Cave Research Institute of Korea 2022) was excluded from this assessment due to potential controversy over its validity and requires further review.", "usetrade": "There is no trade in this taxon."}]}
