It may be more widespread, but there are no data to support this at present. It meets the area requirements under criterion B for Endangered and it is known from one location based on the threat of fishing. However, continuing declines or extreme fluctuations in EOO, AOO, habitat quality or population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of subsistence fishing on this species are unknown and it is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi. It is currently only known to occur around the Nankumba Peninsula in the southern part of the lake, but it might be more widespread.", "population": "No information is available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It forages in the water column where it feeds primarily on zooplankton. It spawns throughout the year with two peaks in January to March and August to September. Males build cone shaped bowers in breeding arenas over sand at depths of three to seven metres.", "threats": "Overfishing using chirimila nets is the main threat.", "conservationmeasures": "This species occurs in or near the Lake Malawi National Park.", "usetrade": "This species is not targeted by the ornamental fish trade, but is harvested by utaka fishermen."}]}
