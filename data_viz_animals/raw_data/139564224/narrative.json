However <em>P. poncei</em> is very similar to <em>P. palawana </em>structurally and might eventually prove to be a junior synonym of this species.</p>", "rationale": "<p><em>Prodasineura palawana</em> is known from about 20 locations in Balabac, Busuanga, Dumaran and Palawan in the Philippines An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but the AOO is not likely to be large, certainly not much greater than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> and together with the extent and quality of suitable habitat will be declining due to loss of forest within the range of this species. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by the combined area of these islands, but is greater than 20,000 km\u00b2. The overall population will certainly be declining as a result of deforestation on Busuanga and Dumaran and low-lying parts of Palawan and is believed to already be severely fragmented. This species would qualify for Vulnerable status under criteria B1ab((ii,iii) if the EOO was smaller or the AOO was known to be below 2,000 km\u00b2. There is certainly cause for concern over this species and, taking the precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, it is assessed as Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Prodasineura palawana</em> is known from Balabac, Busuanga, Dumaran and Palawan in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.

The assessor is aware of records from at least 20 locations but it has only been possible to assign separate coordinates to 19 of these for mapping purposes. The species is likely (but not confirmed) to be present in protected areas, for instance the Mount Mantalingajan Protected Landscape. It is certainly present in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area which might receive protected status. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is not likely to be particularly large and will be declining due to loss of forest within the range of this species.
