{"name": "884", "result": [{"species_id": 884, "taxonomicnotes": "There are no notable issues.", "rationale": "This is an endemic species of the Western Cape Province, South Africa (Extent of Occurrence 9,294 km<sup>2 </sup>Area of Occupancy 44 km<sup>2</sup>). There are six locations. No adults have been seen at the type locality for many years, possibly due to habitat loss caused by too frequent fires during the flight period, but range size figures tentatively include this site. Encroachment by alien vegetation is also resulting in ongoing degradation of habitat throughout its range. The taxon thus qualifies globally under the IUCN criteria as Vulnerable under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to the Western Cape Province in South Africa, from Red Hill in Simonstown on the Cape Peninsula in the west to the Quaggaskloof dam (Worcester) in the east, south to Struisbaai and Pella mission station near Mamre in the north, in small isolated subpopulations.", "population": "No population size data are currently available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It occurs on flat, sandy, open ground among low-growing fynbos, from just above sea level to about 300 m in altitude.", "threats": "This species is threatened by habitat loss due to inappropriate fires, urban and informal housing developments, and invasive alien plants. Fire frequency and intensity is exacerbated by build-up of invasive alien vegetation.", "conservationmeasures": "Effective fire management and eradication of invasive plants is required at the main sites. More research is needed to establish whether additional subpopulations exist. At the type locality, reintroduction of the species is needed as it has not been observed there for many years, and the immediate area should be fenced.", "usetrade": null}]}
