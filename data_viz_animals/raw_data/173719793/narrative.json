An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is inferred to be declining along with the quality and extent of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 5,380\u20139,089 km\u00b2. The overall population is believed to already be severely fragmented. The species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)). It is hoped that additional data will allow reassessment to Near Threatened or (less likely) Least Concern in future.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Coeliccia matti</em> is endemic to Viet Nam where it is known from the south (Phan and Kompier 2016, Kompier unpub. data, Phan unpub. data).

An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 5,380 km\u00b2 (based on a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around the known data points); its maximum EOO is 9,089 km\u00b2 (based on an MCP around the HydroBASINS known to be occupied by this species).</p>", "population": "<p>This species can be common where it occurs.
