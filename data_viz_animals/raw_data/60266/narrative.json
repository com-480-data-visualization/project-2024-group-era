Full credit to the new synonymy is given in Clausnitzer and Dijkstra (2005).", "rationale": "Ischnura abyssinica is endemic to Ethiopian highlands and has been recorded from a few sites. Most of the records are more than 70 years old and surveys are urgently needed, to check, whether the Ethiopian Bluetail still dwells there. The habitat are grassy streams and pools in highland meadows. This anthropogenic habitat is common in the Ethiopian highlands and the distant records suggests that the species is more widespread. Nevertheless this species is endemic to highlands in central Ethiopia and a decrease of the original area of occupancy is inferred due to intense agriculture and pollution of water, which will continue in the future with the fast growing population in Ethiopia, especially in the highland areas. Thus the species is listed as NT. With an ongoing population decline, it would meet the B1a and B2a(ii,iii) criteria.", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from Highlands (2,000 m Asl) in north east (Lake Alemaya) and in central (highland meadow near, Adis Alem) Ethiopia.<br/><br/>In northeastern Africa, the species is endemic to the Ethiopian highlands.", "population": "Population size and trends are unknown.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Grassy lake shores and stream-pools in highlands.", "threats": "Water pollution and degradation of lakes, rivers and streams are main threats to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "Conservation of the watershed is needed, as well as research into the population numbers and range.", "usetrade": null}]}
