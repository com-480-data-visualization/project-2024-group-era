Population size and population trend are unknown. While there are currently no major threats to the lake, the introduction of non-native species or changes to current land-use around the lake are plausible future threats that have the potential to considerably increase the extinction risk of this species.

However, this species is known from very few georeferenced museum collections (GBIF 2019), and additional sampling would be useful in determining if range extends outside of the crater lake. </p>  The surface area of the lake is approximately 3.8 km<sup>2</sup> (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2000). Therefore, Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area of Occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be approximately 8 km<sup>2</sup>, based on the extent of available georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2019), a 2x2 km<sup>2</sup> grid overlain on the known distribution, and the current assumption that this species is restricted to the crater lake.", "population": "<p>Total population size is unknown.
