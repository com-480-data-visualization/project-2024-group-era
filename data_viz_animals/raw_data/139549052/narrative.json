An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but the AOO may well be small and is likely to be declining due to loss of forest in Palawan. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species is constrained by that of Palawan (approximately 12,189 km\u00b2) and is therefore less than 20,000 km\u00b2. The habitat requirements of the species may not be well understood and information is lacking on its ability to tolerate disturbance. It is not definitely known to occur in any currently gazetted totally protected area. The species qualifies for Vulnerable status under criterion D2 and taking a reasonable precautionary approach is assessed as such. It is likely that the AOO and quality and extent of suitable habitat for the species are declining as well, in which case Vulnerable would also be justified under B1ab(ii,iii), however our understanding of the species habitat requirements is not good enough to be sure about these declines.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Diplacina paragua</em> is only known from Palawan in the Philippines (Villanueva 2012, Villanueva <em>et al</em>. 2018).

One of the known locations is in the Cleopatra\u2019s Needle area, which may receive protected status in the future, this is not far from the&#160;Puerto Princesa&#160;Subterranean River National Park so the species may occur in that National Park.

It perched on the ground and the exposed surface of rocks along the water. The stream was shallow with slow to very slow-moving, clear cold water. The substrate was sandy.\u201d It appears that the species prefers open aspect streams and sections of streams but, since it has only been found in forested areas, it is still highly likely that it is dependent on forest for roosting and foraging.</p>", "threats": "<p>Threats to this species are likely to be mainly from clearance of forest for agriculture.
