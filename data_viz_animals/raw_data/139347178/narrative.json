An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it is unlikely to be large and with the available data is less than 10 km\u00b2 and is inferred to be declining due to disturbance and possibly forest clearance at the type locality, if the true AOO is larger it will be declining due to loss and disturbance of forest throughout Mindanao. In most circumstances this assessor would place a species known from a single location in Data Deficient but the severity of habitat loss in Mindanao is such that this species is undoubtedly threatened and will never qualify for Least Concern. With the currently available information the species qualifies for Critically Endangered and, taking a reasonable precautionary approach, it is assessed as such. It is to be hoped that when more data are available it will be possible to re-assess it as Endangered.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Pericnemis melansoni</em> is known only from the type locality in the Nabunturan area, Compostela Valley, Mindanao, the Philippines (Villanueva <em>et al. </em>2013).
