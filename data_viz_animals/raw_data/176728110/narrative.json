However, it is expected that the species also occurs in other upper portions of tributaries along the Paramaka River, since it was only recently described. Further survey work is needed to look for the species in more localities in order to better understand its true range. There are proposed and ongoing mining activities in the range of distribution, which represent potential severe impacts to the species due to the deposition of sediments and changes in the habitat. It is known from five localities, representing two threat-based locations. It is recommended to monitor the species and the area to better understands its range and the population status. Despite little being known about the species due to its recent description, such as regarding how these impacts affect the species and whether there are additional subpopulations in the tributaries, <em>Guyanancistrus <span class=\"heading2char\">nassauensis</span></em> is assessed as Endangered based on its restricted EOO, AOO, number of locations, and continuing decline in habitat due to severe impacts of gold mining activities.
