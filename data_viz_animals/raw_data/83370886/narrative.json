It has been reported from localities over the entire island, however the observations were usually on single individuals. Studies on naiads show that the species could potentially be locally abundant. More studies are needed to validate this statement. It is assessed as Endangered due to its limited known range, occurrence in a small number of locations, and ongoing habitat destruction.", "geographicrange": "This speies is endemic to Grande Terre Island, New Caledonia (Grand <em>et al</em>. 2014).", "population": "The population size of this species cannot be assessed. It is known from various locations scattered over the main island of New Caledonia. Observations on adults are on single individuals. Winstanley (1984) collected 19 naiads from a single locality which shows that the population number could potentially be high. More studies are needed to validate this statement.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The biology of this species is little known. Its last stage naiad, described by supposition (Winstanley 1984, Fleck 2005), lives in areas of small creeks and their tributaries. Emergences occur at low height above water surface (Winstanley 1984). Fleck (2005) reared several larval stages in laboratory conditions without obtaining any adult because its development is very slow. This author concludes that the larval development takes at least four years.", "threats": "The threats to this species are unknown, but ongoing habitat destruction due to pollution of water and alteration of aquatic habitats are assumed to be a past, ongoing and future threat.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation measures in place for this species. More studies on the population size are needed to establish the actual status on the main island of New Caledonia.", "usetrade": null}]}
