{"name": "157866229", "result": [{"species_id": 157866229, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents along the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from two restricted location in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at depths of 2,200 m to 2,440 m bsl. The species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO), and has been found at only two locations, suggesting that it would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. While Location 1 lies within a Marine Protected Area (Glowka 2003), Location 2 does not and is still vulnerable to the threat of deep-sea mining. We have therefore opted to assess this species as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>Whilst no licences have been granted to date, if mining were to be approved at the unprotected Location 2 vent field, the projected decline in the extent and quality of habitat would likely impact both locations, protected or not, due to the close proximity of the two vent fields, as mining sediment plumes are predicted to spread up to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such an event would drive this species to CR very rapidly, therefore, an urgent reassessment would be merited if there is any change to the status of mining licence arrangements within Canada's EEZ, whereby the assessment should increase to EN B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii), regardless of the MPA status at Location 1.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to two locations at hydrothermal vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Pacific Ocean. A location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with a biologically and geologically coherent identity, and within 80 km of each other. To delineate locations, we started with prescribed management areas, then divided each of these into subareas with a biologically and geologically coherent identity. Finally, we divided these subareas into clusters of vents within 80 km of each other. Each location therefore also has common exposure to relevant potential threats. A distance of 80 km was set as the minimum threshold to separate vent fields into different locations as evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure.&#160;In this case, the two locations lie within 62.2 km of each other within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Canada, however, they are subject to different regulations within their respective prescribed management areas and are thus considered separate locations. Location 1 encompasses the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area (Glowka 2003), whereas, there is currently no such regulation in place at Location 2. The species occurs at active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2,200 m bsl to 2,440 m bsl. It has been observed from two vent fields within a these locations: the Main Endeavor Field (Location 1) and Middle Valley, Bent Hill Massive Sulfide (Location 2) (War\u00e9n and Bouchet 1993, Bergquist 2007). This species is present over very small areas in each of these vent fields.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (War\u00e9n and Bouchet 1993, Bergquist 2007).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at depths of 2,200 m to 2,440 m bsl.", "threats": "This species is known to inhabit two hydrothermal vent fields within close proximity (62.2 km). These location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Canada and as such, are not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact of mining on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al. </em>2018). Evidence from the literature suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. Whilst no mining licences have been granted for the area to date, these vent fields would be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining were to be permitted by the Canadian government.&#160;One of these locations, the Main Endeavour Field, lies within the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area established in 2003 (Glowka 2003). This MPA prohibits the disturbance, damage or removal of any structures or animals without consent from the Minister of Justice for purposes beyond scientific research. We therefore do not consider there to be any threat to Main Endeavour Field at this time. However, there is currently no protection for the second location that this species inhabits, the Middle Valley, Bent Hill Massive Sulfide vent field, leaving open the possibility for the future implementation of mining licences at this location. Furthermore, due to the close proximity between the two vent locations, if mining were to occur at one site, the sediment plumes from mining activity could negatively affect the other, negating the presence of such an MPA. We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licences to be granted as a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "One of the two locations, the Main Endeavour Field, lies within the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area established in 2003 (Glowka 2003). This MPA prohibits the disturbance, damage or removal of any structures or animals without consent from the Minister of Justice for purposes beyond scientific research. However, there are no conservation actions currently in place at the other location where this species is found, the Middle Valley, Bent Hill Massive Sulfide vent field. We recommend that specific national/international legislation is required for the protection of deep-sea habitats and resources. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites along the Juan de Fuca Ridge.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
