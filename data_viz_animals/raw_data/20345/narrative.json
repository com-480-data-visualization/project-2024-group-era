Presently known from eight sites in Arkansas, two in Oklahoma, two in Kansas, and one in Missouri. It is expected that there will be eventual decline from deforestation, development of vacation homes, and pollution. Adults fly high and are difficult to survey, and larvae are very difficult to find, so its abundance is very likely to be underestimated. Estimated extent of occurrence is less than 5,000 km\u00b2 and estimated area of occupancy is less than 2,000 km\u00b2.
