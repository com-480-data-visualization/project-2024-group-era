Although relatively widely distributed there are few records from Luzon itself. The species appears to be forest-dependent but disturbance tolerant but more data on its habitat requirements are needed. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but it may not be particularly large, and is not likely to be significantly greater than 2,000 km\u00b2 and might be considerably less than this. The AOO will be declining, along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest throughout its range. With the available information a Least Concern assessment is not safe for this species and if the AOO was known to be below 2,000 km\u00b2 it would qualify for Vulnerable status, it is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. It is to be hoped that when more data are available, especially from Luzon, that re-assessment to Least Concern will be possible for this species.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Teinobasis filiformis</em> is known from Catanduanes, Luzon and Polillo in the Philippines (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen personal communication 2019: unpublished database of specimens from collection R.
