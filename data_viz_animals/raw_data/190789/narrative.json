Only six locations can be considered as currently known, none of which is totally protected. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) cannot be made with the available data, but it may not be large and the AOO, extent and quality of suitable habitat can be inferred to be declining from loss of lowland forest throughout its range. The species would qualify for Vulnerable status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) if its AOO was known to be less than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> and is therefore, taking the precautionary approach advocated by the IUCN, assessed as Near Threatened until more information becomes available.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Macrogomphus thoracicus</em> is known from a few scattered records from the north of Sumatra (F\u00f6rster 1899, Kr\u00fcger 1898), northern Peninsular Malaysia (Choong &amp; Ng 2014, Donnelly 1998, Dow <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the south of Thailand (Asahina 1993).

It would likely benefit from good conservation practices in plantations, such as leaving wide buffers of original forest around streams and the setting up of conservation areas consisting of original forest and including stream heads, and the strict enforcement of existing regulations for plantations and for logging activities. However species specific conservation measures do not appear to be needed.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
