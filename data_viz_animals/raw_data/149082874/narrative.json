Panamanian records of this species probably represent an undescribed species, but require further study. Total population size and trend are unknown, but it has been reported as abundant at some localities where it occurs. Regional threats include habitat loss resulting from deforestation, municipal and agricultural pollution, and several introduced fishes that are likely to be impacting on the distribution or population status of this species. There is currently no evidence of major population decline, but there is continuing decline in the habitat quality. Uncertainties in the scope of existing threats prevents a reliable estimation of the number of locations where the species occurs, but it is suspected to be fewer than ten.

This species is apparently uncommon in the northern portion and on the Atlantic versant of Costa Rica (Bussing 1998).

This species was dominant in a temporary water body in Ca\u00f1o Negro National Wildlife Refuge, Costa Rica (S\u00e1nchez <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Planned construction of the transoceanic shipping canal in Lake Nicaragua may increase the risk of introduced species and pollution (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2016). The growing expansion of pineapple and other crops in the Sarapiqu\u00ed, San Carlos and other basins in the north Caribbean portion of Costa Rica could adversely affect this species, given the habitat reduction and contamination by agrochemical wastes (A. Angulo pers. comm. 2019). Major watersheds on the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica have been polluted by untreated sewage, agricultural pesticides, and sediment loads (Bower 2014, Arias-Andr\u00e9s <em>et al</em>. 2018, Fournier <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>  </p><p>A number of non-native species have been introduced into Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama (McKaye <em>et al</em>. 1995, Angulo <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>  Existing threats are inferred to have resulted in continuous declines in the quality of available habitat.
