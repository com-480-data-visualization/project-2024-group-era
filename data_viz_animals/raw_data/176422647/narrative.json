The species is known from seven locations in the province, it has an extent of occurrence of 11,367 km\u00b2 and an area of occupancy of 52 km\u00b2. It occurs both in lowland areas as well as in the Drakensberg Mountains. It has lost substantial amounts of habitat to urban development, afforestation and crop cultivation in the lowland parts of its range, loss in these areas is ongoing therefore listed as Vulnerable under criteria B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii).", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.", "population": "There is currently no population information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is a free-living, ground/burrow-dweller. <em>Hermacha bicolor</em> constructs vertical burrows in the ground, similar to those of the Ctenizidae, but the burrows do not have lids. Most burrows recorded were made in the soil, and are well lined with silk, the openings flush with the surface (Hewitt 1915). The males were sampled abundantly with pitfall traps from different altitudes in the Drakensberg at Sani Pass from the Grassland, Indian Ocean Coastal Belt and Savanna biomes.", "threats": "This species has lost habitat to urban development around Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Howick and Port Shepstone, it has also likely lost habitat to afforestation in the Midlands and crop cultivation along the coast.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is present in Ukahlamba Drakensberg World Heritage site.", "usetrade": null}]}
