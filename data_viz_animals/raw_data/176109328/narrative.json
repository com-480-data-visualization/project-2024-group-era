The species&#160;is restricted to piedmont and mountain rivers and the Meta and Guaviare drainages.&#160;Some of these rivers are well-preserved, however, the threats exist in many drainages associated with the expansion of the agricultural and urban frontiers, including deforestation, land-use change, sedimentation and urban effluents.

It is present in piedmont rivers of the Orinoco River Basin in Colombia, and in the Casanare, Meta and Guaviare drainages, including the rivers Cusiana, Caja, Purare and Tocoragua, among others. It is found from Vista Hermosa in the Departamento de Meta to the south to the r\u00edo Tocoragua in the municipality of Tame, Departamento de Arauca to the north.
