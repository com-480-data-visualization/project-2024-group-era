The species is restricted to five lagoons: Progreso, R\u00eda Lagartos, Yalahau (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2005), Celest\u00fan and Chelem (Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2016). This uncommon species is threatened by coastal development, habitat loss and pollution. While its populations are indeed fragmented, the decrease in habitat quantity and quality is restricted to one, perhaps two, of its five localities, and not the largest one. Considering these factors and its extent of occurrence (EOO) of 7,000 km\u00b2, the species is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/></p>", "geographicrange": "<p>This species is endemic to the Gulf of Mexico, where it occurs in coastal brackish to hypersaline epicontinental environments along the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
