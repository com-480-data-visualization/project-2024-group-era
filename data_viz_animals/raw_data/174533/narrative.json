It is likely to occur on the mainland of Sumatra, but this requires confirmation. It is considered to be a Vulnerable species in Singapore. The assessor is aware of records from ten locations to which coordinates can be assigned. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy of this species is not possible with the available data, but it may not be large, quite possibly below 2,000km<sup>2</sup>, and can be inferred to be declining due to loss of and degradation to coastal habitats throughout most of the known range of the species. The extent and quality of suitable habitat and the overall population are also inferred to be declining for the same reason. The overall population of the species is likely to be severely fragmented (but it might have good enough dispersal capabilities to overcome this). It is close to qualifying for Vulnerable status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Mortonagrion arthuri</em> is known from Belitung (Alfarisyi 2018, Dow 2011) and satellite islands (Alfarisyi 2019), Peninsular Malaysia (for instance Dow 2011, Fraser 1942), southern Myanmar (Asahina 1965) Singapore (for instance Dow 2011, Ngiam and Davison 2011) and Thailand (Dow 2011).
