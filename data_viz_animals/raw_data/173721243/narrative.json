An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data, however, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 15,302\u201319,105 km\u00b2. The overall population is observed to be severely fragmented. The species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B (VU B1ab(ii,iii)).

Kosterin (2016) recorded a single male <em>Protosticta</em> resembling this species from a location in the east of Cambodia, however there are differences and the Cambodian location is remote from the confirmed range of the species; this record is treated as only possibly belonging to <em>P. pseudocuriosa </em>here and the location is not included in the EOO calculation. The species occurs in some protected areas (for example, Pu Mat National Park). An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining due to loss of forest within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 15,302 km\u00b2 (based on a minimum convex polygon (MCP) around the known data points); its maximum EOO is 19,105 km\u00b2 (based on an MCP around the HydroBASINS known to be occupied by this species).<br/></p>", "population": "<p>This species can be common where it occurs, but the overall population is clearly severely fragmented and an ongoing decline in overall population is inferred from loss of forest within the range of the species.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>This species is found at small mountain streams within forest.
