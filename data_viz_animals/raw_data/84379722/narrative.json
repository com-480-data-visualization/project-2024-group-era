{"name": "84379722", "result": [{"species_id": 84379722, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is known from Mitano Gorge and several sites in Kibale, Queen Elizabeth and Semliki National Parks in Uganda. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 8,000 km\u00b2, while the area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be around 1,000 km\u00b2. The population is precautionarily considered severely fragmented as between the localities at Mitano Gorge, Kibale Forest, Queen Elizabeth and Semliki National Parks there are no appropriate habitats that could provide habitat for this species, and the species is not able to cover the distance between these localities. In addition and the subpopulations are considered small enough that their viability is questionable&#160;and its habitat is declining due to deforestation and pollution. Therefore the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species has only been recorded from Uganda so far, but its presence in Democratic Republic of the Congo is likely. It is known from Mitano Gorge and several sites in Kibale, Queen Elizabeth and Semliki National Parks.", "population": "No information is available on population size or trends for <em>Chlorocypha flammea</em>, but where it is present several individuals are usually found.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is found in larger forest streams between 700 and 1,200 m altitude in western Uganda.", "threats": "Deforestation and water pollution are the major threats to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "Water pollution is an urgent issue, which needs to be tackled (more sewage works and controls are needed). Deforestation outside of protected areas (PAs) affects more or less the entire area and should be stopped immediately. Even PAs are not left untouched by these activities and they need to be controlled in these areas.", "usetrade": null}]}
