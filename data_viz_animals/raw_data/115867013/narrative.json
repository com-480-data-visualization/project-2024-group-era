{"name": "115867013", "result": [{"species_id": 115867013, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is restricted to a single island with a circumference of about 2.2 km and which is about 2.1 km from the mouth of a small mainland river.&#160;It meets the area requirements under criterion B for Critically Endangered and it is known from one location. However, future declines in habitat quality or population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of sedimentation on this algae-eating species are unknown and it is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi where it is restricted to Lundo Island in Tanzania.", "population": "No information is available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It is strictly bound to rocks, which are usually free of sediment and provides shelter and spawning sites. It is also&#160;infrequently found in intermediate habitats, which surround Lundo Island, in the shallow waters. This species feeds from the aufwuchs on the rocky substrate by combing loose material from the algal matrix, with its food consisting mainly of diatoms and small strands of the blue-green algae. Males in breeding colouration defend a territory centred around a cave among the rocks, with territories usually bordering one another and as close as 75 cm apart. Females commonly form large foraging schools but are regularly found singly as well. Spawning occurs inside the male's cave and mouth-brooding females hide among the rocks where they release their offspring.", "threats": "Sedimentation is a potential threat to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions are in place for this species.", "usetrade": "This species has not been targeted by the ornamental fish trade.&#160;It is of no importance to subsistence fishermen."}]}
