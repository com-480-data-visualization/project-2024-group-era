{"name": "188000682", "result": [{"species_id": 188000682, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "Collections of the species occurred from 1977 to 1982. The historical changes that have occurred in the Maracaibo basin since then have been dramatic and evident, including the eutrophication of the lake and the massive dissemination of floating macrophytes (such as <em>Lemna</em>) in response to the extreme organic loads in the tributaries, the increase in oil spills in the middle and lower river basins (e.g. Catatumbo) and inside the lake, the expansion of aquaculture (e.g. shrimp farms) associated with the final reaches of the rivers and the introduction of predatory species. The above evidence implies a extensive contamination and a decline of habitat of several rivers. This species has a restricted distribution with an extent of occurrence (EOO) best estimated at 2,082 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) best estimated at 208 km<sup>2</sup>. It is suspected there are 1-2 threat-based locations. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered.", "geographicrange": "The species&#160;<em>Hoplomyzon cardosoi</em>&#160;is endemic to the Maracaibo basin and was described from Ca\u00f1o La Raya, a tributary of Escalante river (Carvalho&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). The species also occurs in the rivers Escalante and Aricuais\u00e1, between Perij\u00e1 and Andes ranges, and&#160;probably is dispersed along the humid floodplains associated with Lake Maracaibo. It is possibly extant in Colombia. The species&#160;is reported in four localities with a elevational distribution ranges from 17-34 meters above sea level.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is best estimated at 2,082 km<sup>2</sup>, and the area of occupancy (AOO) is best estimated at 208 km<sup>2</sup>. It is suspected there are <span style=\"\">1-2 t</span>hreat-based locations.<br/><br/>The geographic attributes for <em>Hoplomyzon cardosoi</em>&#160;in this assessment were compiled, arranged and reviewed from the following sources: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF 2020), FishNet2 (Fishnet2 2020), FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2019), SiB Colombia (SiB Colombia 2020) and SpeciesLink (SpeciesLink 2020).", "population": "<em>Hoplomyzon cardosoi</em> is not a common species. There are no data available to estimate the population size, and considering the conditions of rivers where inhabits and agricultural frontier, the population of this species has an unknown trend. However, loss of habitat is being accelerated in the area of distribution of the species, with which a reduction of its population is possible in the future.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species <em>Hoplomyzon cardosoi</em> inhabits floodplains at the south and south-west of Lake Maracaibo. Carvalho <em>et al</em>. (2017) recorded the habitat of a small stream for the type locality, with white waters, slow and fast flowing on sand and pebbles and little marginal and floating vegetation. It can reach 18.5 mm in standard length.", "threats": "In the Maracaibo basin several environmental stressors are recognized that threaten the fluvial habitats where <em>Hoplomyzon cardosoi&#160;</em>occurs. In the floodplains the principal threats are the deforestation of headwaters and riparian zones for agriculture, pollution of streams by urban and agricultural effluents, abstraction of water directly from the rivers, and oil exploitation, including spills and effluents (Oliveira-Miranda <em>et al.</em> 2010, Segnini and Chac\u00f3n 2017, Rinc\u00f3n 2017).", "conservationmeasures": "There are no regulations or programs specific to its protection. The species probably inhabits in the only and superimposed protected areas of the plains, the National Park Ci\u00e9nagas de Juan Manuel and Wildlife Reserve Ci\u00e9nagas de Juan Manuel de Aguas Blancas y Negras (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2020). Recommended actions for conservation are awareness and communications, and recommended actions for research are into the life history, and the actual conditions and trend for the population and habitat. Carvalho<em> et al.</em> (2017) considered this species to be Near Threatened, based on collections of the species from 1977 to 1982.", "usetrade": "Uses of this species are unknown."}]}
