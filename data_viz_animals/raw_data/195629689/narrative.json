The holotype male was found at rest under loose pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>) bark.", "threats": "The clearance of native woodland for intensive forestry or agriculture is likely to threaten this species. Removal of dead wood and old or decayed trees which may support suitable fungi would also be detrimental to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "This species is found in Creag Dhubh SSSI and Eastern Cairngorms SSSI and the Cairngorms SAC, however, it is not a qualifying feature of any of these protected areas.<br/><br/>Woodlands should be maintained in a natural state, retaining any old trees and dead wood, ensuring the continuity of these habitats in the future. Over-grazing by deer should be avoided.", "usetrade": null}]}
