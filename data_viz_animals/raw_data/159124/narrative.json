{"name": "159124", "result": [{"species_id": 159124, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Teinobasis ariel</em>&#160;is apparently the most ubiquitous and common of Pohnpei odonates (Paulson and Buden 2003). For the moment it has been assessed as VU because of its small extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and observed deforestation has been assessed as a potential threat to this species.", "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to Pohnpei, Micronesia, where it occurs island-wide at all elevations.", "population": "It is a common and widespread species on this rather small island.", "populationtrend": "stable", "habitat": "The species prefers fast-flowing rocky streams at all elevations and sedge marshes that are dominated by <em>Mapania</em> at higher elevations; essentially all freshwater habitats in the interior of island (not in open ponds or  coastal plain).  The breeding ecology is poorly known as mating pairs are rarely seen even where they are abundant. Tenerals (freshly moulted individuals) are found in both habitat types, so both used for breeding.  It is also frequently encountered in forest understorey well away from water.", "threats": "Deforestation probably represents a threat, as most populations are found in forested areas. Two-thirds of lowland native forest was lost between 1975 and 1995.  There is continued rain-forest clearing at a slow rate and this may represent a threat over time to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats of this species.", "conservationmeasures": "This species is not present in any protected area. Conservation Society of Pohnpeis (http://www.serehd.org/html/about_us_.html) is the primary source of conservation actions on the island, mostly through raising community awareness.", "usetrade": null}]}
