The species seems to be associated with lowland marshes with dense riparian vegetation providing shade. Recent records are found even from urban or semi-urban areas with scattered marshy habitats. The extent and quality of suitable habitat for the species are observed to be declining due to loss and degradation of marshlands and forest and other threats within its range.</p>", "threats": "<p>This is a species that inhabits marshlands with dense vegetation. The primary threats for the species includes destruction of wetlands and associated riparian vegetation and aquatic pollution due to agricultural and industrial activities.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The following steps are needed for the affective conservation of this species and other Odonata endemic to Sri Lanka: </p>  <p>(1) Enforce and supplement existing conservation measures in protected areas. In many cases the protective legislation doesn\u2019t stop the gross destruction of the habitat with the consequent loss of species. Agricultural expansion in forest areas slowly but consistently encroaches important areas by the cutting of undergrowth and small scale logging. When vegetation is removed or damaged around streams and seeps, there are negative effects on many dragonfly species. </p>  <p>(2) Establish new protected areas in the central and southwestern part of Sri Lanka and enlarge existing ones. Several patches of rainforests or partly degraded areas with exceptionally rich fauna and flora are excluded from the current protected area network. The conservation focus should be on the wet zone and montane areas where the majority of the island\u2019s endemics are found. </p>  <p>(3) Enforce existing legislation and legislate additional protection for the smallest streams, rivulets and forest corridors in the wet zone. Streams, rivulets and forest corridors need legislation to prohibit the diversion of streams and clearcutting from the edges since this destroys the dragonfly habitats. Buffer zones of natural vegetation, especially around swamps and flowing waters, should be mandatory by legislation. </p>  <p>(4) Enforce measures to avoid siltation and unnatural flow regimes of running waters. Damming streams or piping springs should be minimized, especially in key dragonfly conservation areas. Water extraction for consumption and irrigation should be sustainable, taking into account the integrity of the habitat and its biodiversity. </p>  <p>(5) Minimize the chemical and organic pollution of water habitats. The impact of the over-use of various agricultural chemicals and insecticides in Sri Lanka is virtually unknown, but surely has a strong negative impact on species, including humans. </p>  <p>(6) Restore degraded areas in key locations. The natural potential for restoration is very high in partly degraded habitats, and a favourable conservation status can be restored in a relatively short time with simple measures. </p>  <p>(7) Conduct comprehensive odonatological faunistic work in protected areas of the central and southwestern part of the island, including regular monitoring as a subsequent step. The amount of much needed new knowledge gathered in this way would be immense. Without this baseline information, specific conservation guidelines are hard to elaborate and effective conservation measures on the local level cannot be undertaken. </p>  <p>(8) Raise awareness on the threat status of the endemic dragonfly fauna of Sri Lanka among local scientists, students, nature tour guides and naturalists, as well as relevant nature conservation authorities and organisations, both locally and internationally.</p>  <p>(9) As voucher specimen are vital in confirming the identity of newly discovered populations and as additional research is required on threatened endemic dragonfly species, it is highly recommended to support and encourage taxonomic and faunistic work as important conservation actions. A more convenient process of obtaining permits from a centralized permit issuing agency should be enforced in future.</p><p></p>", "usetrade": null}]}
