{"name": "59854", "result": [{"species_id": 59854, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is assessed as NT in view of its restricted area, habitat requirements (montane mountain streams) and localised distribution (e.g., Samways 1999). Threats include commercial forestry, some invasive trees (especially acacias), introduced fish species (trout), habitat loss, and siltation of streams in montane areas (Samways pers. comm.). i.e. loss of native trees and reafforestation with introduce species. It will meet the Vulnerable criteria B2ab(iii), if habitat degradation continues.", "geographicrange": "The species has been recorded from north South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi (Mt Mulanje), northern Mozambique. It is a southern African endemic, which occurs mainly along montane forest streams and trickles.", "population": "No information available.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "Montane forest streams.", "threats": "The main threat to the species is forest destruction caused by agriculture and wood extraction are threats to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation measures known but information on taxonomy, population ecology, habitat status and population trends would be valuable. Habitat/site based conservation is also required.", "usetrade": null}]}
