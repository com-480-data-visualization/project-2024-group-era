An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is likely to be small and with the presently available data can be assumed to be below 500km<sup>2</sup>. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest in northern Luzon. In most circumstance this assessor would only place such a poorly known species in Data Deficient but the fact that this species was not found among material from northern Luzon in the extensive M\u00fcller collection suggests strongly that the species is likely to be genuinely extremely local in occurrence and quite possibly confined to a small area. The severity of threats to forest-dependent Odonata in the north of Luzon is such that Least Concern is not likely to ever be justified for this species and therefore Data Deficient is not an appropriate assessment. It qualifies for Endangered under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and is assessed accordingly. Whilst it is to be hoped that fresh data will allow re-assessment to a lower threat category it is entirely possible that re-assessment to Critically Endangered will be required.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Risiocnemis hamalaineni</em> is known only from the type locality in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park on Luzon in the Philippines, collected in 2008 (Villanueva 2009).

Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
