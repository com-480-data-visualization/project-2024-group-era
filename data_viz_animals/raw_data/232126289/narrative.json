{"name": "232126289", "result": [{"species_id": 232126289, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<em>Parasitala miyanagai</em> has only been found on Ulleung Island and Heuksan Island, Republic of Korea. According to our analysis of distributional data, its maximum area of occupancy (AOO) is 104 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and maximum extent of occurrence (EOO) is 3,546 km<sup>2</sup>.<br/> <br/>There are two major drivers responsible for the continuing decline of this species\u2019 habitat and population. (1) crop field conversions and infrastructure constructions in the past; (2) realignment of urbanization by the upcoming airports. These continuing declines meet subcriteria b(iii,v).<br/><br/>Currently, the status of this species doesn't meet subcriteria a or c. This is because the majority of the remaining habitat of this species is located within protected forest areas. Even though these protected areas have historically been violated many times, for now, there is no basis to identify geographically distinct threat-based locations where such violations will occur in the future. After the completion of the upcoming airports in each islands, the local governments will devise and announce their development plans. After this, then, reliable threat-based locations can be calculated. Meanwhile, there is a lack of information to detect severe fragmentation or extreme fluctuations.<br/><br/>Presently, this species is only close to criteria B1 and B2 for Endangered. Therefore, this assessment concludes this species\u2019 category as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "<em>Parasitala miyanagai</em> is a land snail endemic to the Republic of Korea (National Institute of Biological Resources 2014). Historically, this species has only been found on Ulleung Island and Heuksan Island, small islands with total areas of 73 km<sup>2</sup> and 19.7 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. On Ulleung Island, the quality decline in forest area and conversion near human habitations are thought to be responsible for the decrease in this species' distribution (National Institute of Biological Resources 2012).<br/><br/> Due to the limited knowledge of this species' ecology and the small number of samples, a habitat map has been created for this assessment based on the general preference of land snails in Korea. They are known to prefer broad-leaved forests. On this basis, the habitat range in Ulleung Island was first restricted to <em>Fagus engleriana</em> and <em>Acer okamotoanum</em> communities on the actual vegetation map (Jung <em>et al</em>. 2001). On Heuksan Island, <em>Castanopsis cuspidata</em> var. <em>sieboldii</em> forests, <em>Machilus thunbergii</em> community, <em>Camellia japonica </em>community and <em>Quercus acuta</em> community were considered (Cho <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a geographical tree map (Korea Forest Service 2022), a detailed boundary has been contoured. Finally, crop fields and human facilities that are visually identified in GPS satellite images (Google Earth 2022; ver. 9.182.0.0) were excluded. Consequently, this species' maximum AOO and EOO were estimated to be 104 km<sup>2</sup> and 3,546 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Since this map shows the maximum range of habitats available on the two islands, the actual habitat area should be much smaller. Even so, the AOO and EOO meet the threshold for B1 and B2 of EN.", "population": "Historically, this species has been rarely observed (National Institute of Biological Resources 2014). So far, this species has been recorded only through Kuroda and Hukuda (1944), Kwon (1990) and J. Lee pers. obs. (unknown date) (see NIBR 2023).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "So far, little is known about this species' ecology. It is known that this species lives in moist and shaded environments in forest areas. This snail eats litter and humus on soil. Due to the limited geographical distribution of this taxon, it is suspected that there is little dispersal, colonization and, therefore, very limited gene exchange between subpopulations. It makes this taxon very vulnerable to forest area reduction and fragmentation.", "threats": "There have been two drivers of continuing decline in area and quality of the habitats in Ulleung Island.<br/><br/> (1) Historical decline driven by human activities: The continued decline has been inferred, tied to general human activities in Ulleung Island (National Institute of Biological Resources 2012). Despite the total forest area remaining constant since the 1970's on this island, there are a few possible factors that have been suggested as catalysts for the declines in this species' distribution. First, there have been large scale constructions - such as the Ulleung belt way (Korea Development Institute 2010), military bases (Oh 2001), and stone mining from mountains (Oh 2001) - placing directly upon its past occupancies inferred from soil condition (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2001) and the forest community there (Oh 2001, Jung <em>et al</em>. 2001). Second, there has been continuous conversion of habitats into special crop fields. The forest conversion to open fields could have directly contributed to habitat loss (Korea University Research and Business Foundation 2011) since these crops require the same physical, soil, and location conditions as the habitat of this species (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2014). The area of this crop land grew by 15% (0.401 km<sup>2</sup>) during 2010-2017 (Southern Regional Korea Forest Service 2018). The area will keep increasing into the future (Southern Regional Korea Forest Service 2018). Third, the urbanization of human settlements. The area of infrastructure including roads (increased by 1.3 km2 until 2021), factories (0.06 km<sup>2</sup>), and parking lots (0.02 km<sup>2</sup>) has grown steadily since the 1980's (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport 2021) and this also may have been affect to the decline (Korea University Research and Business Foundation 2011). Meanwhile, these declines currently have been limited in Heuksan Island.<br/><br/> (2) Projected decline driven by the two upcoming airports: The increased number of visitors after the completion of Ulleung Airport and Heuksan Airport are projected to facilitate or bring about declines. On Ulleung Island, declines are projected based on historical trends of a positive correlation between the number of visitors and the number of building extensions and alterations (Pohang Branch, The Bank of Korea 2013), the number of buildings and facilities (Pohang Branch-The Bank of Korea 2013), and the proportion of the local population employed in tourism-related and construction (Choi and Cho 2001, Pohang Branch-The Bank of Korea 2013), after this land became more accessible to inland tourists (Choi and Cho 2001). Upon opening up Ulleung Airport in 2025, the number of annual visitors is predicted to increase by about three times (by the 2040's) from 335,220 (average of 2010-2019; Korea Development Institute 2013a). It is also suspected that the current underdevelopment of this island will not cope with the growing number of visitors (Kim 2022). To this end, it is expected that there will be work to expand roads, housing, electricity plants, tour facilities, as well as additional infrastructure facilities on this island (Kim 2022). On Heuksan Island, apart from the location of Heuksan Airport directly on this species' possible occupancy, plan are being considered to construct several facilities to cope with the growing number of visitors. For example, there is a plan to increase accommodations and restaurants by 3.5 and 25 times, respectively (Gwangju Jeonnam Research Institute 2016). Upon opening up this airport in 2027, the number of annual visitors is predicted to increase by about 3.5 times (by 2040's) from 426,000 (average of 2000-2011; Korea Development Institute 2013b). Thus, in light of the past continuing decline due to urbanization, changes brought by the upcoming airports are expected to result in a decline in the area and the quality of habitats.", "conservationmeasures": "To begin with, it is necessary to study the species' distribution status, habitat, ecology, and population size. Based on this, conservation strategies and protected areas should be established before human activities in the future begin seriously. Even in forest areas protected by the Korean natural monument law, additional conservation strategies need to be implemented. This is because there is a history of violations in these areas (e.g. changing the land's legal status to build hotels and other tour facilities, or building military facilities above this legal restriction). Meanwhile, residents in Ulleung Island are using snail-targeted pesticides in a wide range of areas to prevent damage to crops caused by exotic slugs (Y. Chul pers. comm. 2019). A protocol for management supervision on this should be established.", "usetrade": "There has been no trade in this taxon."}]}
