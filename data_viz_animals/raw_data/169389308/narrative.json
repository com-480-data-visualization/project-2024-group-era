However, as per the information provided by taxonomic experts (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020) at the Pakistan Red List Assessment Meeting (February 2020), <em>G. naziri</em> is a valid endemic species of Pakistan.", "rationale": "<em>Glyptothorax naziri</em> is widely distributed in many rivers of Pakistan. Due to planned hydro-power projects, the population is suspected to decline by 20-25% in the next 10 years. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "<em>Glyptothorax naziri</em> is endemic to Pakistan where it is found in Neelam, Jhelum and Siran rivers, in lower Swat, Kabul, Kohar Toi, and Haro rivers and in lower Kurram (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "population": "The species is quite common in all the rivers at present, but due to planned hydro-power projects, the population is suspected to decline by 20-25% in the next 10 years (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "It is a fish of cold to cool waters with stony, gravely beds. It prefers shallow waters of riffle areas of rivers and streams. It is carnivorous (M. Rafique pers. comm. 2020).", "threats": "Damming, pollution, and sand and gravel mining are the biggest threats. Due to its high adaptability, its tolerance to changes is higher than other <em>Glyptothorax</em> species.", "conservationmeasures": "The species is not protected under any law.", "usetrade": "The species is not in use."}]}
