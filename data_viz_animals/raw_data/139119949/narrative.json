At least one of the known locations is protected in the Shimentai Nature Reserve. An accurate estimate of its area of occupancy (AOO) is not possible with the available data. However, the AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss of forest and pollution of streams with pesticides within the range of the species. Its minimum extent of occurrence (EOO) is smaller than 5,000 km\u00b2.
