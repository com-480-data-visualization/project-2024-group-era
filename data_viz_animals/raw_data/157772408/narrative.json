{"name": "157772408", "result": [{"species_id": 157772408, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from one restricted location, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at a depth of 2,003 m bsl. As the species occurs only at hydrothermal vent fields, has a restricted area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO), and has been found at one location, the plausible threat of future anthropogenic influence from deep-sea mining in these sites justifies the assessment of the species as Vulnerable D2.&#160;While no licences have been granted to date, if mining were to be approved within the Fiji EEZ, the projected decline in the extent and quality of habitat would drive this species to CR very rapidly. Therefore, an urgent reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements or if there are future changes to the prices of relevant commodities, whereby the assessment would probably increase to Critically Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). Conversely, a reassessment would also be merited if a moratorium on deep-sea mining was reached by the Government of Fiji, whereby the assessment would decrease to Least Concern.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to one location at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. This location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with biologically and geologically coherent identity. Any vent fields within this location therefore also have common exposure to relevant potential threats. This location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Fiji. The species is currently known from one vent field with active black smokers and diffuse venting located at a depth of 2,003 m bsl, namely the White Lady vent field in the North Fiji Basin (Beck 1996, Desbruyeres 2006). This species is present over a small area at this vent field.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Beck 1996, Desbruyeres 2006).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at a depth of 2,003 m bsl.", "threats": "The White Lady vent field lies within the Fiji Exclusive Economic Zone and is not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al</em>. 2018). There are currently no deep-sea mining licences granted within the EEZ of Fiji. However, as it is not subject to international governance and legislation, this vent field would be vulnerable to considerable anthropogenic disturbances if future development of deep-sea mining was to be permitted. This is particularly concerning for developing countries where there may be limited capacity to undertake appropriate environmental impact assessments and develop and enforce environmental laws to manage deep-sea mining activities (Hoagland <em>et al.</em> 2010). Furthermore, there is currently no protection, such as marine protected areas, in place for these vent fields, leaving the window open for Fiji to consider the future implementation of mining licences. We therefore consider the potential for future deep-sea mining licenses to be granted as a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at any vent fields within the Fiji EEZ, however, a 10-year moratorium on deep-sea mining was preliminarily proposed by Fiji at the 2019 Pacific Islands Forum to allow for scientific research within the regional territorial waters (Kakee 2020). Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites within the region.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of the species."}]}
