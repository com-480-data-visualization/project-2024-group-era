Threats exist at all locations, including the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but it is not likely to be large. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. The known extent of occurrence (EOO) is less than 20,000 km\u00b2.
