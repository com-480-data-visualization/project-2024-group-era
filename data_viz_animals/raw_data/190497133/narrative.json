{"name": "190497133", "result": [{"species_id": 190497133, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is listed as Near Threatened on the basis that this species has an extent of occurrence below 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> and is considered to occur at a single location defined by impacts from climate change. This species is associated with wetland habitats in alpine meadows that are expected to be highly sensitive to increased frequency and severity of droughts and fires, but no significant change in habitat quality has yet been observed. As such the species is close to but does not currently qualify for listing as Vulnerable applying Criterion B1, but does approach the requirements, hence its listing as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is known from the central plateau northwest to Vale of Belvoir Conservation Area in Tasmania, Australia. It may occur more widely than is currently known both beyond but particularly between known localities. It has an elevational range of 600-1,100 m asl.", "population": "It is a reasonably common species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "This species occurs in swamps, bogs and wetlands in sub-alpine and alpine meadows. It lays its eggs in shallow soil.", "threats": "The main threats to this high-elevation species are likely to be temperature extremes and increases in the frequency and intensity of fire resulting from climate change. Climate change is a potential threat to this species, in particular due to drying of its wetland habitat and habitat shifting. Bushfires are probably an increasing threat in both scale and severity but data regarding their impacts on this species are lacking.", "conservationmeasures": "Its range includes several protected areas, including Cradle National Park.", "usetrade": "There is no known use of or trade in this species."}]}
