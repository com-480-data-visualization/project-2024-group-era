{"name": "85590206", "result": [{"species_id": 85590206, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "The present species is known from only two locations with an area of occupancy (\u0391\u039f\u039f) of 8 km\u00b2 in the Autonomous Monastic State of the Holy Mountain (Athos), Chalkidiki, Greece. Logging and fire could locally affect its very restricted range, but habitat alteration resulting from droughts due to climate change may threaten this species in its whole range in the future, possibly resulting in it becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct within a short time frame. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D2. Further research is needed upon the species distribution and range.", "geographicrange": "The present species&#160;is known only from a very small area in the Autonomous Monastic State of the Holy Mountain (Mount Athos), Agio Oros, Greece (Reisch\u00fctz and Reisch\u00fctz 2014).", "population": "The species has never been found alive but this does not mean it is not extant, since it is subterranean and difficult to collect alive.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "No live specimens have been found so far, but the species is most probably subterranean since it was found together with another live subterranean&#160;species (Reisch\u00fctz and Reisch\u00fctz 2014).", "threats": "Logging and fire can locally pose a threat to the species, although alteration of its subterranean habitat resulting from droughts may pose a bigger threat in the future.", "conservationmeasures": "Confirmation of this mollusc's distribution and range is required.", "usetrade": "This species is not used or traded."}]}
