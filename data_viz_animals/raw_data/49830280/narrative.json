Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 15,553 km<sup>2</sup>. Total population size and population trend are unknown. However, mining activities, land-use changes and agricultural expansion along major transportation corridors, and deforestation associated with these activities are producing a continuous inferred decline in habitat quality throughout much of the species range. Given uncertainties regarding species distribution, and the scope and magnitude of major pervasive threats, the number of locations where this species occurs cannot be determined. Therefore, <em>H. punctatum</em> is assessed as Near Threatened because it nearly meets all subcriteria for classification under a threatened category using criterion B1ab(iii).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Hoplosternum punctatum</em> is distributed in Pacific coastal drainages in eastern Panama southward to the Atrato River on the Atlantic slope of northwestern Colombia (Reis <em>et al</em>. 2003, Maldonado-Ocampo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Donascimiento <em>et al</em>. 2017). Distribution may extend into Atlantic slope drainages of eastern Panama (Smith and Bermingham 2005). The type locality of this species is the Marte Arnade River (most probably&#160;the Mat\u00edas Hern\u00e1ndez River), approximately 6 miles east of Panama City (Reis <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 15,553 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a minimum convex polygon calculated around georeferenced collection records (GBIF 2019).

Diet comprises a broad range of food items, including insects, crustaceans, fishes and organic debris (Breder 1927).

Threats to habitat quality include heavy metal pollution, sedimentation, deforestation, and land-use changes (Etter <em>et al</em>. 2006, Vallejo Toro <em>et al</em>. 2016, Palacios-Torres <em>et al</em>. 2018, Pecharroman 2018, Palacios-Torres <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>  While the scope and magnitude of these specific impacts are unknown, they are having a continuous inferred decline in habitat quality.", "conservationmeasures": "There are currently no species-specific conservation measures directed towards <em>H. punctatum</em>. The range of this species extends partly into Darien National Park (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2019), which may provide indirect protection against habitat degradation.
