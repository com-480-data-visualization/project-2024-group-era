The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at around 28 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;from the current known localities, and while this likely to be an underestimate, based on the current information, it is unlikely to be greater than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. There is no information about the population of this species, but there is a decline in the quality of the habitat, as rivers in which the species occurs are used for human activities, such as washing. Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened, as it is close to qualifying for a threatened Category under Criterion B.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Madagascar, found in the north, central and western parts of the country (Bistr\u00f6m <em>et al.</em> 2015). The extent of occurrence (EOO) of this species is estimated to be around&#160;152,693-192,190 km<sup>2</sup>. Based on the known occurrences, the minimum area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be around 28 km<sup>2</sup> but this is likely to be an underestimate, and could be anything up to 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>.", "population": "There is no information about the population trend of this species.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species was found in running water and at a waterhole, as well as a degraded river with lots of vegetation, that is used by women to wash clothes in (Bistr\u00f6m&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). This suggests there is a decline in the quality and the extent of the habitat.", "threats": "As this species is found in running water, such as rivers, it may be threatened by pollution and activities that impact water management. However, the species has been found to occur in degraded environments, and therefore may be adaptable, so it is not known to what extent these threats impact this species.", "conservationmeasures": "This species has been found in Manjakatompo Reserve. Further research on the population, threats and habitat trends are recommended to inform appropriate conservation measures.", "usetrade": "This species is not known to be used or traded."}]}
