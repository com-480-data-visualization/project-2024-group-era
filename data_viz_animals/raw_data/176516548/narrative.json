It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 10,744 km<sup>2</sup>. The distribution is located in a region of importance for the cattle  sector, and recent activities also include soybean agriculture that  totally modify the land. The impact of these threats to the species are severe, and there are at most 10 threat-based locations based on these activities. The area of occupancy (AOO) is inferred to be in continuing decline due to variations in rainfall each year. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.", "geographicrange": "This species occurs in seasonal ponds in the dry Chaco region, Paraguay River basin, Paraguay (Amato 1986).", "population": "The population documentation is null.
