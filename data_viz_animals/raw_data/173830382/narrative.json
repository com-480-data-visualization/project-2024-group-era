{"name": "173830382", "result": [{"species_id": 173830382, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "<p><em>Cynolebias ochraceus</em><strong> </strong>is known only from its type locality, a small series of interconnected pools close to highway BR-349, about 12 km from the town of Bom Jesus da Lapa in the middle S\u00e3o Francisco River basin, Bahia, Brazil. Area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence&#160;(EOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup>, and the species is assigned to a single threat-based location. Total population size and population trend are unknown, but this species was rare during all sampling trips. Habitat was first sampled in 1999 and consisted of several temporary pools characterized by in-tact Cerrado vegetation along the margins of the pools. Subsequent sampling trips in 2009 reported that 280 m<sup>2</sup> (93%) of the original habitat had been destroyed due to deforestation associated with agricultural expansion. Therefore, inferred and continuing decline in habitat quality and availability is inferred and <em>C. ochraceus</em> is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B1b(iii)+2ab(iii). Site protection and captive management are immediate conservation priorities that will likely be necessary to prevent the extinction of this species in the immediate future.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Cynolebias ochraceus</em><strong> </strong>is known only from its type locality, a small series of interconnected pools close to highway BR-349, about 12 km from the town of Bom Jesus da Lapa, Bahia state, Brazil (Costa 2014). One additional specimen was reported from a pool near the village of Malhada, suggesting a potentially broader distribution in the middle S\u00e3o Francisco River basin &#160;(Costa 2014). However, because this record cannot be substantiated, range is considered to be restricted to the type locality until additional ichthyological survey can verify a potentially larger distribution. Recent surveys in nearby temporary pools have failed to detect this species (Costa 2014). </p>  <p>Area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are estimated to be 4 km<sup>2</sup> based on a single 2x2 km grid overlain on top of the type locality (Costa 2014). This species is assigned to a single threat-based location, given a restricted distribution and localized deforestation associated with agricultural expansion that has resulted in the destruction of most suitable habitat at the type locality (Costa 2014).</p>", "population": "<p>The total population size and population trend of this species are unknown.

Additional ichthyological surveys in potentially suitable habitat are urgently needed to clarify the conservation status of this species. Additional information regarding population size and population trend would be useful in clarifying extinction risk. Site protection and captive management are warranted conservation priorities, given the pervasive threat of agricultural expansion that could result in the complete loss of temporary pond habitat in the immediate future.</p>", "usetrade": "<p>There is no information regarding the use and trade of this species. </p>"}]}
