{"name": "157781173", "result": [{"species_id": 157781173, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This unique marine gastropod is restricted to hydrothermal vents at deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from one restricted location, in the distinctive microhabitats of active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting, located at a depth of 701 m bsl, and would be severely threatened by the anthropogenic impacts associated with mineral extraction if commercial deep-sea mining were to occur in this region. The potential for anthropogenic influence at this site based on exploration licences for mineral extraction at or adjacent to the sites supports a projected continuing decline in quality of habitat. There may already be disturbance to this species as JOGMNC (Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation)&#160;is in the process of testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation-phase licensing. The impact of uncertainty around the decline in habitat means that the applicable threat level for this species ranges from VU to CR, using the recommended risk tolerance. We have opted to take a precautionary approach based on this level of uncertainty and therefore assessed the species as the top of this range, Critically Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii). A reassessment would be merited if there was a substantial change to the status of mining licence arrangements.", "geographicrange": "This deep-sea gastropod is restricted to one location at hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. This location encompasses vent fields within a prescribed management area, with biologically and geologically coherent identity. Any vent fields within this location therefore also have common exposure to relevant potential threats. This location lies within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan. The species is currently known from one vent field with active black smokers and diffuse venting located at a depth of 701 m bsl, namely the Minami-Ensei Knoll vent field in the Okinawa Trough (Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2016, Ogura <em>et al.</em> 2018). This species is present over a small area at this vent field.", "population": "These populations have only been sampled by remotely operated or human-occupied vehicles, and given the presence at depth, it is difficult to ascertain the population status (Sasaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, Ogura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "The species is restricted to hydrothermal vents on deep ocean ridges in the West Pacific Ocean. It is currently known from active black smokers and sites of diffuse venting located at a depth of 701 m bsl.", "threats": "The Minami-Ensei Knoll vent field lies within the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone and is not subject to International Seabed Authority governance. The exploitation of polymetallic sulphide mineral resources, which form at active hydrothermal vents, is currently being widely explored. As the locations are remote and at depth, the impact on the subpopulations is uncertain, although recent studies have concluded that a net loss of biodiversity will be an inevitable outcome of deep-sea mining (Niner <em>et al.</em> 2018). The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) has developed test mining equipment, which targets seafloor massive sulphides and at the time of this assessment is in the process of conducting verification tests (Shirayama <em>et al.</em> 2017). Polymetallic sulphide resource exploration can include some extraction of mineral deposits to determine their composition, and testing of seabed mining technology for future exploitation phases, hence there may already be disturbance of the subpopulation. As well as direct impacts, evidence from the literature also suggests that sediment plumes from mining activity could spread across distances of 60 to 70 km (Luick 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such sediment plumes will smother adjacent seabed communities, thus degrading the habitat quality. Associated threats are likely to include impacts to gas exchange and feeding ability, delay or prevention of the recolonisation of mined areas, or additional unknown effects of exposure. We therefore consider the current exploratory mining and the likelihood of future exploitative mining licences within the Japan EEZ to be a significant threat to the species.", "conservationmeasures": "There are no conservation actions currently in place at any vent fields within the Japan EEZ. Further research is recommended to predict the impacts on populations from disturbance by mining and to confirm whether the species is present at any other vent sites within the region.", "usetrade": "There is no known trade or use of this species."}]}
