Generally, it utilises hard water, with pH 7.8-8.3 and generally clear, light blue to turquoise (visibility may exceed 20 m in the dry season in the headwaters). Yearly temperatures vary from 18-28 \u00b0C and dissolved oxygen ranges from 7 to 10 mg/l. Aquatic plants are absent in R\u00edo Tamasopo. Substrates are rocky, varying from large boulders to limestone sediments, and commonly including driftwood. Currents are moderate to fast (18-45 cm/s) and depth is generally about 2.0-4.0 m, with stream widths of 5-30 m. Adjacent vegetation comprises lush tropical forest, with trees more than 20 m tall (Miller<em> et al.</em>&#160;2005, Soto-Galera <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).<span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\"><em></em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>", "threats": "The species is threatened by untreated waste waters from sugar mills, pesticides and fertilizers used in sugar cane agriculture, increased run-off and sedimentation (Arriaga-Cabrera <em>et al.</em> 1998).", "conservationmeasures": "No conservation actions for <em>Herichthys tamasopoensis</em> are known.
