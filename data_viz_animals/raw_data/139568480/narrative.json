Deforestation is a threat at Mount Isarog even though it is a protected area and at all other potential locations in the same part of Luzon. Based on the currently available data the area of occupancy (AOO) of the species is believed to be less than 200 km\u00b2 and inferred to be declining, as are the extent and quality of suitable habitat, all because of loss and degradation of forest habitats in the area. Even if the species is found on other mountains, severe fragmentation seems certain because of the loss of forest that has occurred throughout the region. The species qualifies for Endangered status under criterion B2ab(ii,iii).</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta myzouris</em> is only known from the type locality on Mount Isarog in Camarines Sur Province in Luzon in the Philippines (van Tol 2005). Mount Isarog is protected as a National Park, but the park boundary is not clear to the assessor and there has been considerable deforestation all around the mountain at the altitudes where this species has been recorded. An accurate estimate of itsd area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but if genuinely confined to Mount Isarog then it is less than 200 km\u00b2, probably considerably less. However, some small patches of suitable habitat appear to remain in surrounding areas and it may be more widely distributed beyond the Mount Isarog area than is currently known. The AOO can be inferred to be declining due to loss of and disturbance to the remaining forest in the areas of the known location.</p>", "population": "<p>There is insufficient information to make any statement about current population sizes and health for this species except that some decline, probably ongoing, in overall population size is inferred from loss of forest in the region where it occurs.</p>", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "<p>Nothing has been recorded on the habitats and ecology of this species but it will be forest dependent and is almost certainly a stream species. An ongoing decline in both quality and extent of suitable habitat is inferred from loss of and disturbance to the remaining forest in the areas of the known location.</p>", "threats": "<p>The main threats to this species will be from illegal logging (for timber or charcoal production) and (illegal) clearance of forest for agriculture. Mount Isarog is a volcano and may still be active so eruptions are another potential threat to the species.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>More data on this species are urgently needed, on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance. More information is also needed on how secure Mount Isarog National Park is and better protection may be needed there. Any conservation measures not focused on protection of habitat will be at best futile and might actually be counterproductive, for instance blanket bans on collection of specimens will hamper searches for additional populations of the species, since vital voucher specimens to confirm identification will not be available.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
