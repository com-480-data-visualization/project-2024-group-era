It meets the area requirements under criterion B for Critically Endangered and, based on the threat of sedimentation, it is known from one location. However, future declines in habitat quality or population size are possible but uncertain. The effects of sedimentation on this species are unknown and it is, therefore, listed as Near Threatened.", "geographicrange": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi. It is only known from Mbamba Bay (Tanzania), from where it was first described, and from nearby Hongi Island.", "population": "No information is available on the population.", "populationtrend": "unknown", "habitat": "It occurs in rocky habitat, preferring areas of rocks mixed with sandy bottoms. It occurs in shallow water (0.5\u20136 m depth) but has on occasions been observed at depths of 20 m or more. This species remains very close to the substrate, trying to keep in close contact with the rock surface with its belly, and in trying to do so, it sometimes swims upside down. This species leads a reserved, secretive life and it seems to be weakly territorial.", "threats": "Sedimentation is a threat to this species.", "conservationmeasures": "There is no information available on conservation actions in place.", "usetrade": "This species is not targeted by the ornamental fish trade."}]}
