Threats exist across the range of the species, even within protected areas and severe fragmentation of the population on most islands seems inevitable. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data but although the species is widespread the AOO is unlikely to be large, probably not significantly greater than 2,000 km\u00b2 and is likely considerably smaller. The AOO is inferred to be declining along with the extent and quality of suitable habitat due to loss and degradation of forest across the range of the species. If the AOO was known to be below 2,000 km\u00b2, the species would qualify for Vulnerable status under criteria B2ab(ii,iii) and it is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.</p>", "geographicrange": "<p><em>Drepanosticta mylitta</em> is known from Biliran, Cebu, Dinagat, Homonhon, Leyte, Luzon, Panaon and Samar in the Philippines (Cowley 1936, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Muller 1997, van Tol 2005, Villanueva and Seidenschwarz 2012, Villanueva 2009). The assessor is aware of records from at least 28 locations but it has only been possible to assign separate coordinates to 21 of these for mapping purposes. Some locations are in or near to protected areas, for instance the Bulusan Volcano Natural Park in Luzon. An accurate estimate of the area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is not possible with the available data, but although the species is widespread the AOO is unlikely to be large; it is probably not significantly greater than 2,000 km\u00b2 and likely considerably smaller.

For instance for the Bulusan Volcano Natural Park in Luzon, based on data compiled in 2001 BirdLife International (2019) state: \u201cThe natural habitats of the park have declined over the years as a result of extensive kaingin [slash and burn agriculture] activities, fuelwood gathering and the illegal cutting of trees. Intense, uncontrolled hunting further impacts on the biodiversity of the park.\u201d The assessor does not know if the situation has improved since 2001.</p>", "conservationmeasures": "<p>The priorities for this species are for better protection of habitat where it occurs and for more information on its distribution, exact habitat requirements and ability to tolerate disturbance.</p>", "usetrade": null}]}
