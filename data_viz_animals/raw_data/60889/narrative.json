{"name": "60889", "result": [{"species_id": 60889, "taxonomicnotes": null, "rationale": "This species is endemic to Lake Malawi, the main threat to this species is overfishing with a local decline in fishery catches recorded for the southern parts of the lake. It was not recorded during the 2016 survey in the southern part of the lake. As a predator, it easily falls victim to hook-and-line fishermen who also operate in the shallow water. Due to increased fishing efforts in inshore waters, <em>N. fuscotaeniatus</em> is now assessed as Vulnerable. It meets the population size reduction requirements under criterion A for Vulnerable based on a suspected population reduction of 30% in the last 10 years. The decline in population size continues as hook-and-line fishermen are still targeting predatory haplochromines in the shallow water.", "geographicrange": "Endemic to Lake Malawi,&#160;<em>N. fuscotaeniatus</em> occurs in the southern part of the lake, from Kande Island to Mangochi along the western shore, and from Metangula (Mozambique) to Mangochi on the eastern shoreline.", "population": "The population is in decline. It was not recorded during a 2016 trawl survey of the southern part of the lake.", "populationtrend": "decreasing", "habitat": "It prefers the intermediate habitat up to a depth of 35 m, but is also frequently found in vegetated areas no deeper than 15 m. It is a predator that feeds on small fishes, with territorial males only defending territories when spawning and the females guarding the fry.", "threats": "Subsistence fishing and irregular extraction by the ornamental fish trade are threats.", "conservationmeasures": "No information is available on conservation actions.", "usetrade": "It is irregularly collected by the ornamental fish trade and known as \"Haplochromis Fusco\". It is targeted by subsistence fishermen using hook and line."}]}
