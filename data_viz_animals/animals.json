This turbulence is worsen by the threat of&#160;agricultural intensification in adjacent basins, that has been linked to decreases in surface-water flows and extensive loss of habitat in the Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas basin. With such threats, <em>Lucania interioris</em>&#160;is thought to inhabit no more than 10 fragmented locations, holding an extent of occurrence of 4,733 km<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the species is assessed as Endangered.",
            "geographicrange": "<em>Lucania interioris </em>is restricted to the isolated regions of the endorheic Bolson de Cuatro Cienegas biological reserve in Coahulia, Mexico. Within the dessert valley it occurs in three major drainage regions of the basin and is limited primarily to naturally fragmented and physicochemically severe habitats of the valley floor (Miller <em>et al. </em>2005, Carson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Precise localities of this species, as collected by Carson <em>et al. </em>(2015) in 2014, were: R\u00edo Garabatal, Juan Santos, Las Salinas, El Laberinto, Laguna de los Burros, T\u00edo C\u00e1ndido, Los Hundidos and Laguna San Pablo.",

This species, though abundant in its small distribution area in Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas, comprises many scattered and small populations that are isolated one from each other (H. Espinosa-P\u00e9rez pers. comm<em>.&#160;</em>2019). <br/><br/>Carson <em>et al.</em> (2015) mentioned that the gene flow among most of these populations is interrupted (H. Espinosa-P\u00e9rez &amp; C. Lambarri pers. comm. 2019). Since populations are not connected, some are severely threatened, such as the Garabatal (Eastern Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas) and Mezquites (central Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas) (H. Espinosa-P\u00e9rez &amp; C. Lambarri pers. comm.<em>&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>Populations are known to be subject to large and rapid changes in local abundance (\u2018boom and bust\u2019 ecology) and also presumed high rates of genetic drift that accompany its small populations (Frankham <em>et al.</em> 2002, Allendorf and Luikart 2007).

These habitats are prone to extreme and rapid fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and size, causing large and rapid changes in local abundance (\u2018boom and bust\u2019 ecology), fragmentation and, presumably, to high rates of genetic drift that accompany small populations (Frankham <em>et al.</em> 2002, Allendorf and Luikart 2007). Pools where this species inhabits are already too shallow and water in the marshes fluctuates too much both in water level and physicochemical characteristics for the species to tolerate (H.

This poses a severe threat to the species, given the vulnerable and fragile species natural habitat characterised by ephemeral and intermittent shallow pools already prone to extreme and rapid fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and size (H.

In 1983, Uyeno <em>et al</em>. published studies on the Karyotypes of Goodeids and A. Radda attached importance to these results, According to identical Karyotypes, he transfered 1984 this species into the genus <em>Girardinichthys</em>. Though phylogenetic results since the early 2000's (Doadrio and Dom\u00ednguez, 2004) supported the individuality of the genus <em>Hubbsina</em>, Radda held onto his system, in 2004 raising the stock from the Lago Zacap\u00fa to species rank describing it as <em>Girardinichthys ireneae. </em>This stock is&#160;now regarded as subpopulation of <em>Hubbsina turneri</em>. According to its affiliation to three drainages, three subpopulations are distinguished: The R\u00edo Grande de Morelia subpopulation (type subpopulation), the Laguna Yurir\u00eda subpopulation and the R\u00edo Angulo subpopulation. The first two subpopulations are regarded Extinct. This species is here considered valid in the genus <em>Hubbsina </em>de Buen, 1940 following&#160;Ram\u00edrez-Herrej\u00f3n&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2010).

It furthermore inhabits the flat area of the former Zacapu paleolake. &#160;In 2013 a population was discovered in a tiny spring in the village of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, which is an affluent of the Canal Patera, the main source of the R\u00edo Angulo  at Villa Jim\u00e9nez, but this spring has dried up in recent years. It now is only found in Lago Zacapu.<br/><br/>A study carried out by&#160;Dom\u00ednguez-Dom\u00ednguez&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2008) found that the Highland Splitfin has disappeared from more than the 65% of its historical range.",

The water is clear to usually turbid or muddy, vegetation is present and dense, mainly green algae, <em>Potamogeton</em>, <em>Eichhornia</em>, <em>Typha</em> and <em>Scirpus</em>. The Laguna de Zacap\u00fa is a spring-fed lake, drained by the R\u00edo Angulo, which divides in two streams after 20 km. The habitat is 0.5 to 1 m deep and the ground is predominantly of mud which leads to a translucent (greenish) to turbid water. The Highland Splitfin prefers well planted areas, where it is hiding under the aquatic vegetation, including <em>Chara</em>, <em>Potamogeton</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum</em> and green algae (Miller, 2005). <em>Hubbsina turneri</em> is a semi-nocturnal predator feeding from small Crustacea, Bloodworms and Mosquito larvae. It usually hides by day and hunts at dusk and dawn.<br/><br/>The Lago Zacap\u00fa is an irregular shaped small lagoon with an extension from the north-west to the south-west, length about 670 m, width about 470 m. In the south-west corner of the lake begins the dammed outlet, extending east-north-east upward over a length of about 800 m and 60 m wide over the whole length. The outlet ends with a southwards bended hook with an extension of 150 x 90 m. After the dam, the affluent of the Canal or R\u00edo Angulo begins and merges into it after about 6.5 km.

The water was, in one place, greenish brown but clear with little current and partly shaded by trees; in the other place, brownish but clear, with little current as well.

Also, with the confluence of fish species, migratory birds, plants and endemic amphibians (<em>Ambystoma andersoni</em>), it can be considered as a broad transitional zone, giving it great ecological importance. Two main sections of Lago Zacap\u00fa differ, with one of depths between 4 to 6 m, and the other region from 12 to 90 m deep, bedded by soils and alluvium (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1465, 2004).</p>",

Altitudinal shifts in range have already been observed for other similar species, suggesting this is also affecting this species, and resulting in a continuing decline in quality and extent of habitat. The species has an estimated extent of occurrence of 97,000 km\u00b2,&#160;but within this a currently known area of occupancy of only 12 km\u00b2 (based on the IUCN Guidelines of a 2 x 2 km grid overlaid on the three known localities). This is likely to be an underestimate as any further localities recorded will increase the area of occupancy. However, the estimate is well within the threshold for Endangered, even if many more localities are discovered. As it is currently known from only four localities, which under the threat of climate change affecting the species would translate into a single location, the species is listed as Endangered under Criterion B2ab(iii). While any further localities recorded may ultimately drop the species' extinction risk to Vulnerable due to an increase in area of occupancy, our current estimate is well below the Endangered threshold of 500&#160;km\u00b2.",

The estimated extent of occurrence is around 121 km\u00b2, while the known area of occupancy to date is 12-32 km\u00b2&#160;due to the limited number of localities known for this species (three broad localities, but within Veracruz, multiple localities near Xalapa, as indicated by GBIF records).",

            "threats": "Climate change is the main threat to this species as it only appears to occur at high altitudes.&#160;As a result, this species is assumed to be restricted to a narrow geographic area. Climatic change is the most severe threat to restricted range, high elevation species which occupy a very specific climatic niche, particularly as several species have already been seen to have migrated several hundred metres uphill over the period since the description of this species (T. Larsen pers. comm. 2013). With species eventually running out of suitable habitat and climatic niche when they reach mountain tops, so called \"mountain top extinctions\" are expected to occur more frequently with continuing climatic change. This is assumed to cause a continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat available to the species within the estimated extent of occurrence, and if further data were available on this species it would also likely be reflected as a continuing decline in the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of this species.",

            "habitat": "<em>Brycon orbignyanus</em> originally occurred in middle to large sized rivers, and at floodplain lakes and channels associated with large rivers. The species preferred forested rivers and was considered to be mainly frugivorous. However in 46 specimens from the Paran\u00e1 river, stomach contents included insects and other invertebrates, vegetal matter, and fishes (Lima 2017).<br/><br/>Size at first maturation is reported to be 30 cm TL, being reached at 2\u20133 years of age. The species is well-known as a migratory species. At the lower rio Paran\u00e1 and rio Uruguai at Argentina and Uruguay, it migrated downstream during October, moving upstream during March. Breeding in the southern part of the range of the species took place between December and January. On other hand, at the upper rio Paran\u00e1 basin the reproductive migration is undertaken upstream (Ihering 1929, Magalh\u00e3es 1931, Godoy 1975, Lima 2017). The upstream migration in rio Mogi-Gua\u00e7\u00fa started by the end of September, and spawning took place between November and January (Godoy 1975, Lima 2017). At the rio Piracicaba, Magalh\u00e3es (1931,&#160;<em>via&#160;</em> Lima 2017) reported reproductive schools moving upstream the river between December and January, and, on one occasion, hundreds of specimens were observed entering a flooded area, the males then apparently chasing the females. Ihering (1929) estimated that females ranging between 570 and 690 mm in total length possessed a total fecundity of 500,000 to 1,000,000 oocytes. After spawning, the species moves downstream, sometimes considerably far from the spawning site. Godoy (1975,&#160;<em>via</em>&#160;Lima 2017) reported that two specimens captured and tagged at Cachoeira de Emas (rio Mogi Gua\u00e7\u00fa) were recaptured two to four months later 601\u2013637 km downstream, into the rio Grande. Thorm\u00e4hlen de Gil (1949,&#160;<em>via</em> Lima 2017) studied annuli rings in scales and calculated that specimens between 90\u2013116 mm SL are less than two years old, specimens between 123\u2013215 mm SL are 2\u20133 years old and specimens between 229\u2013245 mm SL are 4\u20135 years old (Lima 2017).",

Dry conditions are necessary for successful embryo development and viability (Berois<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014). Soils with high percentage of clay seem to be the best for egg deposition. The minimum wet period for individuals to reach maturity and reproduce is around two months; reproduction is continuous from adulthood to death (Berois&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Garcia&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, 2019). Ponds may be filled by rains or adjacent stream floods. Adults are found in a wide range of water temperatures from 6\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C, but higher temperatures could reduce survival. Austrolebias species feed on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (microcrustaceans, oligochaetes, insect larvae, arachnids, etc.) (Laufer <em>et al. </em>2009). Potential predators are larger annual (<em>A. wolterstorffi, A. cheradophilus</em>) and non-annual fish (Erythrinidae, Heptapteridae) species, insect larvae, aquatic snakes and birds.",

Annual fishes are very popular in the pet trade, and national regulations of collecting activities are not tight. &#160;</li><li>Abstraction of surface water (agricultural use). Rice crops modify freshwater courses that may affect annual fish populations by draining natural wetlands.</li><li>Nutrient loads. Rice and soy crops use high quantities of fertilizers that may cause eutrophication in seasonal ponds.&#160;</li><li>Herbicides and pesticides.&#160;Rice and soy crops use high quantities of these substances that may reduce subpopulation viability (Zebral <em>et al.</em> 2018).</li><li>Droughts. Considering global climate change predictions, severe droughts for more than two consecutive years may eliminate subpopulations of annual fishes. &#160;&#160;</li><li>Storms &amp; flooding.

It is thought to be declining in population and range due to the major threats of excessive aquifer depletion and pollution. The rate of population decline is unknown but may be severe, and some populations may be on the verge of extirpation. It likely has between 10 to 15 threat-based Locations, as some sites are probably hydrologically connected while others are likely undiscovered within its range. It therefore could fall into a range of Categories from Near Threatened to Endangered. As a precaution it is assessed as Vulnerable B1ab(iii), and studies of its distribution and population trends is urgently needed alongside site protection and restoration.",

It has also recently been recorded in Val Verde Country in Texas, USA, in portions of the Edwards-Trinity Aquifer near the Mexican border (Cohen <em>et al.</em> 2018), bringing the number of known localities to 1-14 over an extent of occurrence of 10,500 km<sup>2</sup> throughout its range (Dugan<em> et al.</em> 2017). Most of its population is thought to be inaccessible to collectors and it is likely widely distributed in northern Coahuila, although explorations in 2005 indicated possible extensive extirpations of populations along what was likely the former eastern edge of its distribution due to aquifer exploitation (Miller&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).",
            "population": "The current population size is unknown. Surveys in 2001 found this species to have a relatively low abundance in sites accessible to divers, however larger populations may be found in areas not so easily accessed (Hendrickson<em> et al. </em>2001). The population in northern Mexico is thought to be declining and may be on the verge of extirpation in some areas due to excessive aquifer depletion (Caballos <em>et al. </em>2016).",

They are mostly found in still pools but can also be seen in flowing systems and are often associated with silt substrate (Hendrickson<em> et al. </em>2001). In aquarium conditions they can survive for 4 months without food and have been observed spending extended periods of time showing no signs of muscular activity (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2005). They do not have functioning eyes but have acute auditory, lateral line and chemosensory sensitivity (Hendrickson<em> et al.</em> 2001), which they can use to detect organic debris and invertebrates, such as mosquito larvae, in surrounding water while in total darkness (Cohen <em>et al.</em> 2018). It has a maximum reported standard length of 77 mm in the laboratory (Miller <em>et al.</em><em>&#160;</em>2005).",
            "threats": "The habitat of this species is under intense pressure from water over abstraction and is mostly without any formal protection (Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> 2000). The arid region in which it lives faces rapid population growth with increasing groundwater exploitation for municipal, agricultural and industrial uses (Hendrickson <em>et al.</em> 2001). Explorations around 2005 indicated possible extensive extirpations of populations along what was likely the former eastern edge of its distribution due to this threat (Miller <em>et al.</em><em>&#160;</em>2005). Its subterranean freshwater habitats are also thought to be affected by contamination from industrial and agricultural run-off (Dinerstein <em>et al. </em>2000). The threat of over-collection for the aquarium trade has also been listed for this species, and as no successful attempts at captive breeding have been recorded, all individuals are wild caught (Proudlove 2001). In Texas the newly discovered population of this species is also threatened by oil and gas drilling (Dugan<em> et al.</em> 2017).",
            "conservationmeasures": "This species is a fully protected and federally listed endangered species in Texas (Cohen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Research is needed into its distribution and population trends, and water quality and level need to be maintained or restored throughout its habitat.",
            "usetrade": "This species is thought to be threatened by over-collection for the aquarium trade and captive populations exist in the USA (Proudlove 2001)."

            "rationale": "Most populations of <em>Ophisternon infernale </em>(all of those in the State of Yucatan, which are the majority) are threatened by pollution (garbage, sewage) and excessive water extraction (for urban and livestock uses), processes that have already destroyed at least one location and likely extirpated the species from another site. Based on the limited distribution of the species (specifically, area of occupancy), currently known threats and an estimate of four locations, the species is listed as Endangered (EN).",
            "geographicrange": "<em>Ophisternon infernale </em>is a strictly hypogean freshwater fish species, endemic to the Yucatan Peninsula, and found in flooded caves associated with cenotes, in the states of Yucatan and Quintana Roo, Mexico (Miller<em> et al.</em> 2005, Ceballos<em> et al.</em> 2016). These cenotes and groundwater are on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico (20\u201321\u00b0N, 88\u201390\u00b0W), including anchialine caves on the Caribbean coast. This species is sympatric in some areas with <em>Ogilbia pearsei</em> (Bythitidae) and <em>Rhamdia guatemalensis</em> (Pimelodidae) (Chumba-Segura 1984). Though the hydrology of the Yucatan is currently understood to be a highly interconnected system, the scale of threats and the impact of localized events on distant subpopulations is poorly understood. For this reason, the number of locations for the species is not well established. However, based on the pervasiveness of the threat of pollution and groundwater extraction the number of threats is unlikely to exceed ten (J. Arroyave pers. comm. 2018).",
            "population": "The population seems to be low, but stable, in locations in Quintana Roo but not in Yucatan localities (which are the majority), where at least one has been destroyed. In another locality, the species has not been seen recently, and in all there is severe ongoing threat by pollution and excessive water extraction (Ceballos <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Very few specimens have been observed in the localities (Medina-Gonz\u00e1lez <em>et al.</em> 2001, J. Arroyave pers. comm. 2018). Although it has been reported to co-occur with the other endemic hypogean fish of the Yucatan Peninsula, <em>T. pearsei</em>&#160;(Medina-Gonz\u00e1lez <em>et al.</em> 2001), <em>O. infernale</em> has not been found in most of the localities with populations of&#160;<em>T. pearsei</em>&#160;(J. Arroyave pers. obs. 2018). This may be&#160;a result of its cryptic habits and low population sizes, rather than its complete absence from these localities.<br/>Underwater exploration should increase the number of recorded sites. Several locals in rural areas have seen <em>Typhlias</em><em>&#160;pearsei&#160;</em>but not <em>Ophisternon infernale</em>.",
            "populationtrend": "unknown",
            "habitat": "This species is a strictly hypogean freshwater fish. In some caves where the species is found in the state of Yucatan, the water is accessible without diving, which makes this fish prone to pollution from garbage and organic matter from visitors. On the contrary, in the state of Quintana Roo its environment is pristine, and the species can only be seen by cave divers. In both cases, the species lives strictly in freshwater, with within temperatures of about 22-24 \u00b0C (to 27 \u00b0C in Yucatan) (J. Schmitter-Soto pers. comm. 2018). The species is a&#160;detritivore, but also preys on benthic crustaceans e.g. <em>Creaseria morleyi </em>(Ceballos <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/>Microhabitat preferences in&#160;<em>O. infernale </em>include muddy bottoms where the species burrows, as well as submerged roots from nearby vegetation where the species appears to hide (J. Arroyave pers. obs. 2018).",
            "threats": "The species has a low population density and is less frequent than the other blind fish in the Yucatan Peninsula,&#160;<em>Typhlias pearsei</em>. In addition, some of its locations, especially in the state&#160;of Yucatan, are affected by solid waste and other sources of pollution from tourist visitors. In addition, water extraction for urban use or pig farms not only threatens to dry out some localities, but can also prompt the intrusion of saline water into the aquifer (Ceballos <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;As with the other endemic hypogean freshwater fish species from the region, such as&#160;<em>T. pearsei</em>, the main threats to <em>O. infernale</em>&#160;and its habitat include water pollution (resulting from inadequate sewage treatment and wastewater disposal), increased groundwater extraction and decreased aquifer recharge (both exacerbated by the tremendous growth of the tourism industry in the region), and saltwater intrusion (Kane 2016, Deng<em> et al.</em> 2017, Saint-Loup <em>et al.</em> 2018).",
            "conservationmeasures": "There are no known conservation actions for <em>O. infernale</em>, but&#160;the cave of Kantem\u00f3 lies within the polygon of the protected area of Balam Kaax, Quintana Roo (J. Schmitter-Soto pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>The American Fisheries Society Endangered Species Committee lists&#160;<em>O. infernale</em>&#160;as endangered due to current or estimated destruction, modification, or reduction of a its habitat or range, and a restricted range (Jelks <em>et al. </em>2008).&#160;Similarly, <em>O. infernale</em>&#160;is federally listed as endangered in the Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (SEMARNAT 2010), a compendium of species or populations of wild flora and fauna at risk in Mexican territory.",

            "population": "This species is reported to have low population densities across its range (Barriga-Sosa <em>et al.</em> 2002), but it was still captured in 2013 (Mercado-Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is considered a pescado blanco, or 'whitefish'.&#160; In Lake Chapala, fishery production according to species composition for the year 2000 did not consider whitefish due to their low abundance (they have not been registered since 1990; Rojas and Sasso 2005).",

            "habitat": "<em>C. promelas</em> is a benthopelagic species that favours open, quiet waters of lakes and sluggish outlets. It feeds on other fish and invertebrates including zooplankton (Ceballos<em> et al.</em> 2016, Mercado-Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015)",
            "threats": "Over many years Lake Chapala has suffered severe water loss; in total, about three-quarters of its volume.  During the past 30 years, the population of Guadalajara, near Lake Chapala, has increased from one to approximately five million. Consequently, the demand for water from Lake Chapala has increased enormously.  This reduces the area available habitat for <em>C. promelas.</em>&#160;The small amount of water entering the lake is highly polluted by untreated waste water from households, industrial sewage and fertilisers from agriculture (Global Nature Fund 2002).  Lake Chapala is suffering because of all the threats acting on it (Miller<em> et al.&#160;</em>2005).<br/><br/>The primary threats to species of&#160;<em>Chirostoma</em>&#160;are habitat loss and degradation resulting from water flow reductions from the Lerma River, in addition to an associated increased water residency time, nutrient enrichment due to agricultural runoff, the release of toxins and pollutants from municipal and industrial sources, overfishing and potential stock collapse, competitive non-native species (e.g.,&#160;<em>Oreochromis aureus</em>), and physical habitat alteration (Lyons <em>et al. </em>1998, Becerra-Munoz<em> et al. </em>2003, de Anda <em>et al. </em>2004, Moncayo-Estrada <em>et al.</em> 2012). Recent estimates suggest that over 3000 fishermen target various species of fishes in Lake Chapala annually (NOM-032-SAG/PESC-2015).<br/><br/>Additionally, Lake Chapala has experienced a long-term continual decline in water volume primarily resulting from increased agricultural demand for ground and surface water (comprising the majority of water-use in the region) (see NOM-032-SAG/PESC-2015). Low water volume may be exacerbated by climatic fluctuations (Filonov <em>et al. </em>2001, Filonov<em>&#160;</em>2002) and by increases in surface transpiration due to nutrient-induced presence of floating macrophytes (Lind and Davalos-Lind 2002).",
            "conservationmeasures": "The species is also covered by the responsible fisheries regulation for the Lake Chapala (NORMA Oficial Mexicana NOM-032-SAG/PESC-2015, Pesca responsable en el Lago de Chapala, ubicado en los estados de Jalisco y Michoac\u00e1n. Especificaciones para el aprovechamiento de los recursos pesqueros).&#160;This standard establishes the minimum catch size for white fish species (<em>Chirostoma promelas, C. sphyraena and C. lucius</em>) of 200 mm of total length. Additionally, <em>C. promelas</em> is included as a threatened species in the \"Carta Nacional Pesquera 2004\".<br/><br/>Fluctuation of lake levels in Chapala is a constant threat, but the Lerma-Chapala watershed council established water allocation practices to maintain water levels in the lake (Boletin 235 de la Comisi\u00f3n de Agua del Estado de Jalisco, and&#160; Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n 05/11/2014 - Colaboraci\u00f3n para Recuperaci\u00f3n de Chapala )",

It has got two right angles in the E and S corner and an open angle in the west corner. The width is about 1 2m, the longest line extends from E to NNW and is about 25 m long. In the sharp NNW angle is an outlet into a dammed sections of the Teuchitl\u00e1n river used as cattle trough, another outlet is on the outer side of the right angle, draining to the subsequent section of the river. The depth of the spring is around 1 m, the walls are concrete but bordered inwards partly with big rocks. In the E angle arises the main spring under the roots of a large <em>Metasequoia</em> tree. Though <em>Ameca splendens </em>can be also found in the following sections of the river, the species prefers to live in the spring area and has got the highest density there. Other species co-existing with the Butterfly Splitfin are the native <em>Goodea atripinnis</em> and the exotics <em>Poecilia mexicana</em>, <em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>, <em>Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus</em> and <em>Oreochromis aureus</em>. In subsequent areas of the river can be found additionally <em>Zoogoneticus purhepechus</em> and <em>Ictalurus dugesii</em>.&#160; <br/><br/>The Butterfly Splitfin almost permanently feeds from algae and aufwuchs growing on the rocks and concrete walls. <em>Ameca splendens</em> is a herbivorous species.<br/><br/>All the spring areas populated with&#160;<em>Ameca splendens</em>&#160;display this species in moderately high numbers and it is usually the dominant native species.",

The La Vega Dam is an important element to the maintenance of the Ameca River as well, as it controls the quality and volume and flow of this river, which is highly detrimental to species inhabiting this river&#160;(Ramsar Secretariat 2009). Additional threats on a&#160; different scale come from people using the Teuchitl\u00e1n spring area as recreation area and from invasive non-native species. While the first threat seems to be negligible at current extent, the aggressive predatory Poeciliid fish species seems to have a much heavier impact, especially outside of the springs.&#160;<em>Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus, </em>one of the invasive species,&#160;is highly aggressive and a major threat to many native fish, being a predator and feeding from fry, attacking juveniles and dispersing them, so a slight reduction in quantity of specimens can be already inferred.",
            "conservationmeasures": "In 2016, Michoac\u00e1n University started a reintroduction project for <em>Zoogoneticus tequila</em> and <em>Notropis amecae</em>, both emdemic to the R\u00edo Ameca headwaters. The first one, a Goodeid, and the second, a Cyprinid species, inhabited the R\u00edo Teuchitl\u00e1n drainage in historical time, but have been extirpated by unknown reasons. The reintroduction area is focusing on the spring area and the subsequent river sections, mainly the part that is used as a trough, and the schedule includes a complete extraction of non-native fish species from these sections and a long term species control. This action would have a direct positive impact on the Butterfly Splitfin as exotics represent about 90% of the individuals, so a recovery of the population can be expected for the following years.",

Given the strong slope of the edges there is emergent aquatic vegetation in only some parts of the axalapasco, represented by ciper\u00e1ceas; these are the sites preferred by this species. The absence of human settlements on the edges or inside the crater has propitiated that the lacustrine body maintains good quality conditions: the only use of water is for domestic work and for the cultivation of exotic fish. The crater lake is a body of clear and relatively cold waters. Throughout an annual cycle the transparency ranges from 2 to 6 m, the temperature from 15 to 19 \u00b0 C, the dissolved oxygen varies from 7 to 8.5 mg/l, the hardness from 37 to 55 mg/l, the pH of 7.7 to 9.1, sulphates of 14 to 24 mg/l, phosphates 0.01 to 0.9 and nitrates of 0.9 to 2.2 mg/L (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992).

In addition, there is a risk of the escape of trout (<em>Onchorynchus mykiss</em>) from the enclosures present in the lake (D\u00edaz-Pardo and Mendoza-Vallejo 2016) and desiccation due to over extraction of water resources and climate change.",

The species AOO is less than 0.78 km<sup>2</sup> and it only has one location based on the most plausible threat: overfishing. The species, however, is also potentially threatened by invasive species, increased sedimentation and salinization due over-extraction of water resources for agriculture. Therefore, the species is assessed as Critically Endangered.",
            "geographicrange": "<em>Poblana letholepis&#160;</em>is a freshwater species endemic to M\u00e9xico, known from the endorheic laguna Mina Preciosa, Puebla (Miller,<em> et al</em>. 2005).",

            "habitat": "<p>It is found in La Preciosa crater lake, a saline system with good water quality (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992). This crater lake has clear, potable and brackish water; substrates (clay, sand, rock) no vegetation and&#160;<em>Scirpus </em>algae along the shoreline (Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It has depths to 1.3 m or more (Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p><p>La Preciosa also has the following characteristics: major axis 1500 m and maximum depth of 50 m; throughout an annual cycle the transparency ranges from 2 to 6 m, the temperature from 15 to 20 \u00b0 C, the dissolved oxygen varies from 7 to 8.5 mg/l, the hardness from 37 to 55 mg/l, the pH of 7.8 to 9, sulfates of 135 to 165 mg/l, phosphates 0.02 to 0.75, nitrates of 0.1 to 2.9 mg/l (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992). But perhaps the most fluctuating limnological parameter is the salinity that varies from 0.5 o/oo (parts per thousand) in the rainy season to 1.1 o/oo (parts per thousand) in the dry season (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992). Possibly due to these changes in salinity there is no aquatic vegetation (E. D\u00edaz-Pardo pers. obs. 2001). To date, there are no actions or effects of human activity, which is why the habitat can be considered as good (D\u00edaz-Pardo pers. obs. 2001). The surface area is 0.78 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Arriaga-Cabrera 1998).</p><p>It is a clearly herbivorous species, vegetal matter (algae) represents 35%, of its diet, crustaceans represent 10% and the insects represent 55% (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992). These are results that differ with those recorded by Flores-Negrete (1998), who reports that this aterinopsid is carnivorous and mainly consumes cladocerans, although it also usually ingests copepods, larvae of insects, molluscs and occasionally seeds and plant remains. The reproductive season happens between May and September (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992, 1993). Flores-Negrete (1991) records reproduction in the months of March and April.&#160;Reproductive recruitment occurs in an average pattern length of 51 mm in both sexes (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992). Maximum fecundity is 5166 eggs in a 76 mm fish (Flores-Negrete 1998).&#160;Maximum known size is 77 mm LP (D\u00edaz-Pardo 1992).</p>",

            "taxonomicnotes": "Seth E. Meek collected the types of this species together with Frank E. Lutz in 1901 from the P\u00e1tzcuaro lake, other specimens from the Zirahu\u00e9n lake (now regarded as a separate species, <em>Allotoca meeki</em>). Meek's collection of <em>Zoogoneticus miniatus</em> from the Lago de Chalco, Valle de M\u00e9xico, had been identified as <em>diazi</em>&#160;with the reason for Meek describing it as a separate species originating in a mistake with the location (\u00c1lvarez del Villar and Narrasco 1957). Finally fish collected from the vicinity of Uruap\u00e1n and regarded as <em>diazi</em> by Hubbs and Turner (1939), have later on been identified as separate species and described as&#160;<em>Allotoca catarinae</em>. The P\u00e1tzcuaro Allotoca is therefore restricted to the endorheic Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro basin with no recognized subpopulations.",
            "rationale": "<em>Allotoca diazi </em>is only known from the endorheic Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro drainage, where it has been extirpated from the lake within the last two or three decades. The last stronghold is the spring at Chapultepec; other known habitats in the headwaters of a southern spring and along the Canal de Ci\u00e9nega need to be surveyed to understand if this species is still extant.&#160;Taking into consideration the small AOO, a single known location, declines in quality of habitats and population and several threats, the species is assessed Critically Endangered.",
            "geographicrange": "The P\u00e1tzcuaro Allotoca is endemic to the Mexican federal state of Michoac\u00e1n where it occurs in the endorheic Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro drainage. Historically known from the lake itself and some of its tributaries, it now seems to be extirpated from the Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro (Corona-Santiago&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015, Zambrano <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and is known from only three collection sites along the Canal la Ci\u00e9nega, mainly from the main spring at the old mill at Chapultepec (Molino Viejo de Chapultepec).",
            "population": "Observations some years ago (Lyons 2011) mention a remnant population of <em>Allotoca diazi</em> in the P\u00e1tzcuaro lake, but recent surveys and samplings (Corona-Santiago <em>et al</em>. 2015, Zambrano&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014) were not successful in finding a single individual there. It is therefore feared that this species has been extirpated from the lake. A spring in the mountains about 3.5 km northeast of Tup\u00e1taro hasn't been visited since 1941 and collection sites along the Canal de Ci\u00e9nega are threatened by water pollution and water hyacinths. The only healthy and strong population is restricted to the spring in Chapultepec.",
            "populationtrend": "decreasing",
            "habitat": "The spring in Chapultepec is an egg shaped and fenced in spring with two effluents, one on the south end, one on the west end. The size is approximately 100 x 50 m, the depth from observations outside of the fence is at least 1.5 m. The P\u00e1tzcuaro Allotoca was found on several surveys from the 1990's to 2017 by K\u00f6ck <em>et al., </em>Lyons<em>&#160;et al. </em>and many others in both effluents, channels from about 80 cm (south channel) to more than 1 m (west channel) in width. Both channels have sandy ground with gravel and several rocks on the borders. In recent years (2014 - 2017), submersed vegetation in the channels occurred in the form of floating water hyacinths, directly after the outlet in the south and in areas with dense<em> Egeria</em> species stocks. Grassy riparian vegetation covered the borders and hung over the surface, while the west channel was partly covered by trees. At the west outlet, some exotic <em>Zantedeschia</em> species grew along the borders, shading the channel partly. This part of the channel was densely planted with<em> Egeria</em> and had a depth of up to 1 m. Around 120 m from the outlet, the channel was dammed, leaving the subsequent part of the channel with depths ranging between 15 and 40 cm. The current in both channels was fast to moderate and the water looked characteristicly milky blue, probably due to dissolved minerals. The vegetation in the spring itself was composed of <em>Egeria</em> species and <em>Potamogeton</em> species. The water parametres taken in March 2017 were: water temperature, 19.5\u00b0C; pH, 7.22; conductivity, 1,180 \u03bcS. Other fish species found here included <em>Alloophorus robustus</em>, <em>Goodea atripinnis</em>, <em>Skiffia lermae </em>and<em>&#160;</em><em>Allotoca dugesii</em>.<br/><br/><em></em><em>Allotoca diazi</em> is a demersal species, except when feeding.  It lives in and near dense beds of vegetation near to the shore, in lakes, spring-fed creeks and ponds.  It is generally found in clear to muddy water, alongside substrates of mud, sand, rocks and plants, with abundant vegetation. Like all <em>Allotoca</em> species, it is mainly carnivorous, feeding on small invertebrates. <br/><br/> The P\u00e1tzcuaro lake, where this species existed a couple of years ago, is surrounded by mountains and rugged topography with a steep slope (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1447, 2005). The lake is an endorheic and eutrophic system (meaning it has no outlet to the sea), and is shallow and turbid with a high concentration of nutrients. The southern part of \u200b\u200bthe lake has an average annual water temperature of 19.2 \u00b0C, and a total alkalinity of 165 mg/l (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1447, 2005). As this lake is a closed system, without significant tributaries, it may be even more sensitive to hydraulic imbalance, with its annual volume variations being mainly determined by precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface runoff and infiltration of water through internal springs. It is also occasionally fed by temporary surface streams during the rainy season, such as the San Gregorio rivers, the Santa Fe and Soto streams in the north. In the extreme southeast, it also receives water through agricultural discharges from the Canal de Ci\u00e9nega or Chapultepec channel (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1447, 2005).",
            "threats": "The main threast to the P\u00e1tzcuaro Allotoca&#160;are water pollution and urban development in the area, including expanding tourism, and introduced exotic fish species. The introduction of Black Bass (<em>Micropterus</em><em>&#160;salmoides</em>) in 1933, along with Common carp (<em>Cyprinus carpio</em>) and Tilapia (<em>Oreochromis niloticus</em>) in the 1970's has contributed to eliminating species from the lake. The common water hyacinth covers the surface of the channels, reducing water flow and interfering with gas exchange. Additionally, as a carnivorous species, increasing turbidity of the habitats reduces chances to find food, especially for fry (Hern\u00e1ndez-Ch\u00e1vez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, for the related species <em>Allotoca catarinae</em>).<br/><br/>It is estimated that the current water infiltration rate of the lake has been reduced from 12% to 8% but, assuming the potential presence of a new period of dry years in the region, the hydraulic contribution of the basin will be critical to maintain the balance of the water level. In addition, erosion and loss of the soil will carry on as the basin continues its process of ecological deterioration; this is expected to reduce water entry into the lake due to the decrease infiltration rate and depletion of surface aquifers. Its waters, exploited since pre-Columbian times, are also effected by the use of surrounding land for agricultural activity, which covers just over 40% of the basin, and approximately 30% of the total area constitutes grasslands used by cattle and horses.<br/><br/>The outflow of the spring at Chapultepec is used for washing laundry by the local people, putting detergents into the water body. Furthermore, water from the spring is used for either drinking water or as raw water for construction work. Nevertheless, the effect on the fish community seems to be negligible as long as the extraction of water is not increasing quantitatively.",
            "conservationmeasures": "The site proposed as Ramsar is located in the southwest part of the Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro, covering an area of \u200b\u200b707 ha extending from the island of Uranden in the south of the lake, following its coast towards the west are the towns of Tzentzenguaro, Santa Ana Chapitiro, San Pedro Pareo, San Bartolo, up to Erongar\u00edcuaro, passing by the surroundings of what was the island of Jaracuaro (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1447, 2005). Unfortunately, the proposing didn't help&#160;<em>Allotoca diazi </em>to survive in this<em>&#160;</em>area.<br/><br/>Zambrano<em> et al.</em> (2014) recommended a programme of intensive fishery of non-native species to favour the native species recovery and to extract the exotic <em>Eichhornia crassipes </em>in the Ramsar area, being shelter of fry and juveniles of non-native fish.&#160;<br/><br/>The P\u00e1tzcuaro Allotoca is included in the international ex-situ breeding project \"<em>Allotoca</em>-Mesa Central\" from the Austrian Association of Aquarists (\u00d6VV\u00d6) for all species of the genera<em> Allotoca</em> and <em>Neoophorus</em> (http://www.oevvoe.org/allotoca-mesa-central). Other&#160;conservation effort is a monitoring and ex-situ breeding project run by the Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Acuatica in Michoacan University, Morelia, Mexico.",

The species EOO comprises less than 5 km<sup>2</sup> including the freshwater springs surrounding the reservoir. A continuing decline in the habitat quality of the species has been observed as a result of dredging, the introduction of exotic fish and industrial pollution and solid waste from tourism. Therefore, the species is assessed as Critically Endangered.",
            "geographicrange": "The species is endemic to the Laguna de Almoloya also known as Laguna Chignahuapan<em>,</em> in Chignahuapan, Federal State of Puebla, Mexico (\u00c1lvarez del Villar 1970).",
            "population": "It is a species known only from its type locality; this restrictive characteristic is added to the low density of its population. In a collection campaign carried out in 2001, it was not possible to capture specimens of the charal&#160;(D\u00edaz-Pardo <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, the species has been found in later surveys in 2014 (H. Espinosa pers. comm. 2018).",

            "habitat": "<p>The lagoon of Almoloya originates in the spring of the same name, its waters form a small lacustrine body, which drains down a tunnel to the Necaxa Dam in Puebla (Sol\u00f3rzano-Preciado and L\u00f3pez 1965). An analysis carried out in June 2001 showed that the lagoon has clear and transparent waters, as the presence of total dissolved solids was not detected, and turbidity barely reached 3.0 UFT. The quantification of nitrates was 0.5 mg/l, sulfates 1.0 mg/l, total phosphorus 0.62 mg/l and total phosphates 2.0 mg/l (E. D\u00edaz-Pardo pers. comm. 2001).</p>",
            "threats": "In the last 30 years, its habitat has been severely altered by dredging work. Also, the introduction of exotic fish such as <em>C. carpio</em> and <em>Onchorynchus mykiss</em> seem to have had some effect on the charal, in addition to habitat loss and degradation caused by industrial pollution and solid wasted from tourism (D\u00edaz-Pardo <em>et al</em>. 2016).",
            "conservationmeasures": "The species is listed in the SEMARNAT 2010 as 'threatened endemic' and found in the CONABIO (the 'The Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad') hydrological priority region.",
