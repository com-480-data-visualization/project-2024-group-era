## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> **General Topic and Main Axis Development**
> Every year, approximately 1,000 species face extinction, raising a critical question: Will humans become the only inhabitants of Earth after several centuries? This pressing concern underscores the urgency for immediate conservation actions. The foundation of effective animal protection lies in enhancing public awareness and consensus, with data serving as a pivotal tool for this purpose. Visualization acts as the conduit, bridging the gap between data and public perception.**Overview, **
>
> **Motivation, and Target Audience**
> Our project aims to create a dynamic and informative webpage targeted primarily at students, fostering increased awareness about endangered animals. This initiative is driven by the belief that education and engagement can catalyze collective action towards animal conservation.
>
> **Visualization Content and Features**
>
> 1. **3D navigable globe:** A visualization showcasing the global distribution of endangered species, offering users a comprehensive understanding of their spread and hotspots.
>
> 2. **Species Profiles:** Detailed profiles for each species, including visuals and information on appearance, diet, habits, behaviors, and conservation measures.
>
> 3. **Educational Content:** Curated educational videos that highlight the importance of conservation efforts and inspire viewers to contribute to these causes.
>
> 4. **Interactive Features:** We plan to integrate innovative interactive elements to further engage users:
>
>    - **EcoSurvival Game:** A captivating game where participants match endangered animals with their ideal ecological requirements, encompassing food, habitats, and more. High scorers will be awarded a certificate of achievement, fostering learning through engaging gameplay.
>
>    - **ML EcoForecast:** An interactive machine learning model allowing users to simulate the impact of various conservation actions on species populations, visually demonstrating the potential outcomes of their efforts.
>
> *Note: Due to time constraints, we will implement either the game or the forecasting. If time permits, we aspire to include both to maximize user engagement and educational value.*

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> **Originality**
>
> Our approach revolutionizes the way endangered animals data is presented by shifting from the traditional, static encyclopedic format to an engaging, dynamic user experience. We introduce a 3D navigable globe that embeds animal profiles, allowing users to explore species by region with simple gestures. This immersive interface is a departure from the norm,  inviting users to engage deeply with the content. Additionally, we innovate by integrating gamification or/and machine learning predictions through features like the EcoSurvival game or/and ML EcoForecast. These elements are designed not just for engagement but to spur users into conservation actions, a significant leap beyond the informational offerings of most sites. In conclusion, Our originality lies in these interactive and educational enhancements, drawing on diverse inspirations to make environmental awareness both informative and enjoyable.

> **Inspiration**
>
> After extensive brainstorming and reviewing some relevant websites,  we've identified several sources (shown as bellows) from which we're considering drawing  inspiration. With preliminary approval from our professors, we MAY adapt some of their innovative ideas to our project.
