            We are a group of computer scientists who are passionate about wildlife conservation. We believe that technology can be used to help protect endangered species and their habitats. Our goal is to raise awareness about the threats facing wildlife and to provide information about conservation efforts around the world. We hope that our website will inspire others to take action and join the fight to save our planet's most vulnerable species.
